He commissioned Bruegel to create a series of six seasonal paintings, the last of which is shown here. The series also included: Gloomy Day (Early Spring; KHM, GG 1837),  Spring (now lost); Hay-Harvest (Early Summer; Nelahozeves Castle, Czech Republic, Lobkowitz Collection); The Harvesters (Late Summer; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art); Return of the Herd (Autumn; KHM, GG 1018). For the composition of this series, Bruegel, who today is regarded as the most progressive landscape painter of the 16th century, followed an older tradition that divided the year, beginning on 1 March, into six unequally long seasons. What all the compositions have in common is the so-called balcony motif, i.e., the depiction of a hill in the foreground from which an overall view of the landscape unfolds. On top of the hill a group of hunters accompanied by a pack of dogs is seen, making their way back to the village below. Their catch is poor: a single fox dangling from the spear the hunter on the left carries on his shoulder. To the hunter\u2019s left, Bruegel added a motif that had been used forquire some time in book illumination for depicting the month of December: the preparations for singeing a pig over an open fire outside a building. The damaged sign hanging above them reveals the name of the inn: \u201cdit is inden Hert\u201d, meaning \u201cTo the Deer\u201d \u2013 a well-aimed passing shot. Entertaining details, such as the people ice-skating on the frozen lakes, have contributed to the painting\u2019s enormous popularity. However, it does not owe its significance in art history to its details but rather to the overall impression conveyed by the coloration and composition. With virtuosity and consistency Bruegel evokes the impression of cold: white, blue-green and brown are the dominant colours. The precise silhouette of the trees, the frozen mill-wheel at the lower right and the icy surface of the snow revealed by the hunters\u2019 footprints blend together to convey the fundamental characteristics of winter. The scene is an invented, universally formulated landscape: the combination of a chain of Alpine mountains with Flemish architecture renders pointless any search for reality."}, {"title": "Melencolia I", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_5viEdtOHQfEXGjuQ4X3udeIwsJNPDzL8NZTHySHX65gfo3aPy9N_6XEErudnBCBYbfFLfOXrm", "desc": null}, {"title": "Medusa", "artist": "Caravaggio Merisi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-klkYZum2-_KfON8q8FXNvVSXNolnuATRXhE4Od9x85lSUfUJ7LPcxfBvA8txIwzQIEbSoyfw", "desc": "In 1598 Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte gave this painted shield to the Grand Duke Ferdinando I.

The Medusa is painted on canvas applied to a wooden shield. The subject is mythological referring to the shield from Athena which was cunningly used to exploit the the Medusas power to petrify people. This iconography was often used by the Medici to represent their military power. Rather than use ancient sculpture for inspiration, the painter captures the expression on the Medusas face, deformed as it is in horror at having been beheaded while even the mane of serpents writhes in all directions; it is the passing moment between life and death"}, {"title": "The Tower of Babel", "artist": "Pieter Bruegel the Elder", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Jy_is1J1w6PW1co7RyPx-GfuKPfGN34ZBTJ35KaMe74URkfR82sm5x3XzCsFJ1h5wfruHttw", "desc": "\u201c[\u2026] Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven;and let us make us a name [\u2026].

Only the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, who collaborated with the Romans, combined records from different sources to create the legend that became accepted (Antiquitates Judaica I,4; 93\u201394 AD).In the book illumination of the Early and High Middle Ages, local buildings that were less than monumental were used as models for the architecture of the Tower of Babel. Starring in the 16th century, artists orientated themselves on theMesopotamian type of step-shaped ziggurat (temple tower), which, however, was rectangular rather than round. Bruegel\u2019s monumental composition had several forerunners in Netherlandish painting, but his work became the most famous classic among the Tower of Babel depictions and was frequently copied in many different variations. The sense of scale is provided by the flemish-style port city, which is impressively tiny in comparison to the tower. With meticulous precision and encyclopaedic interest Bruegel depicts an abundance of technical and mechanical details, from the supply of the building materials in the busy harbour to the various cranes and the scaffolding on the unfinished brick foundation. He sets the workers\u2019 dwellings into the stone outer structure, which blends elements of classical with Romanesque architecture, and they appear to be more than merely temporary. By anchoring the building on the rocky slope, Bruegel creates the impression of static equilibrium. Reaching up to the clouds, the building, however, isoptically distorted and appears to have slightly sunk into the ground on the left side. This is an artistic gesture, on the one hand enhancing the impression of thebuilding\u2019s monumentality, and on the other hand alluding to human hubris and the impossibility of completing the tower because \u201cthe Lord confused the language of all the earth\u201d.

He had lived in London since 1532 and was appointed court painter to the English monarch in 1536, the year of the royal wedding. The monochrome background of the painting is a concession to the demands of the court portrait. In contrast to the technique he used for other subjects, Holbein conceived such portraits with a pronounced flatness, thus giving them a formal character. Jane Seymour\u2019s precious jewellery, her garment and her pale features are bathed in an even light and presented in every detail \u2013 an old-fashioned method that had been superseded by a full-toned chiaroscuro not only in Italian painting (with which Holbein must have beenwell-acquainted).

One of the bagpipe-players draws our attention to the front, where he looks with curiosity at the meagre fare that is being freshly served. Two helpers are using a door that has been taken off its hinges to carry their dishes. A server who is pouring beer into more easily handled jugs and a child eating to one side close off the painting at the front. If we follow the figure at the end of the table who is passing the dishes to the wedding guests, we are led to the true protagonist, the bride. She is sitting silently in front of a length of green cloth, which has been hung along with a paper crown in her honour on the straw wall. According to Flemish custom, the bridegroom was not allowed to attend the celebrations until the evening, and the bride was not permitted either to eat or to speak beforehand. Unfortunately nothing is known about the commissioning of this work, which is probably Bruegel\u2019s most famous. If we knew more, it might help to resolve the controversial question of whether the painting is intended to be a caricature or carry a moralising message. Bruegel scholars in Vienna agree, however, that most of the interpretative proposals made thus far have failed to reveal the true meaning of the painting. Attempts have been made, for example, to connect the large shoes with the German expression \u201cauf gro\u00dfem Fu\u00df leben\u201d (to live in great style) or to see the two-piece bride\u2019s crown as an indication that she is already pregnant. It is far more in keeping with Bruegel\u2019s humanistic conception of himself to see the painting as a neutral observation without further intent.

In Bruegel\u2019s rendering, the violence is expressed not in the bitter nature of the battle \u2013 indeed St Michael and his sparse troops do not appear particularly threatened by the demons \u2013 but by the intensity of the fall \u2013 infernal and endless \u2013 of this crawling, hideous multitude that invades the entire surface of the picture, in a remarkable unity of action which increases its impact. By borrowing minutiously observed elements from the plant, animal, mineral and human worlds and combining them to form hybrid, deformed beings, Bruegel invents creatures that are the most repulsive, but also the most curious and fantastic imaginable. Mussel shells grafted onto a gigantic shrimp, a human head with butterfly wings attached to a shapeless, bloated body, a puffy gnome carrying a sundial and with a plumed helmet on his head, viscous fish with arms, lizard scales, crustacean paws\u2026 a seemingly endless list. Within the m\u00eal\u00e9e, every element is differentiated by the scrupulous rendering of the textures. With their long, refined silhouettes, St Michael\u2019s allies, elegantly garbed in delicate, luminously coloured albs, are automatically on the side of the Good, in a state of grace that enables them to dominate effortlessly the monstrous hordes, moving around in a clear and azure sky which is in profound contrast with the darkness reserved for the rebels. Bruegel reveals himself here to be a marvelous colourist, dexterously distributing accents of red, green, blue and white and alternating the dark browns and lighter beige ochres with brio"}, {"title": "The Wedding Dance", "artist": "Pieter Bruegel the Elder", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9EPHExrZWarr6g_i8hR1sm79po4FDDNWLuJrKlZWNYzmC2xlpH9CIIWRucoW06lemF2meENQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Madonna in the Meadow", "artist": "Raphael", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-rEmrH8IrONKYECnQWlE56WmpPZguczTzwhnk-5qCxrmbSWrI796gQIS64nO6oalQAneW6dg", "desc": "In 1504 the young Raphael came from Perugia to Florence, where Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo dominated artistic life. Especially under the influence of Leonardo\u2019s compositions, the newcomer created a series of Madonna depictions. Particularly in Florence, the Madonna image had experienced a change in function: it was no longer mainly a religious item for practical use, but primarily an exquisite expression of artistic achievement. Raphael gave the Madonna in the Meadow to his Florentine patron Taddeo Taddi as a gift; in 1662 it was acquired at its place of origin by Archduke Ferdinand Karl of Tirol. In keeping with the Sienese type of the Madonna Humilitatis the Virgin Maryis sitting on an elevation on the ground. Supporting the infant Jesus with both hands, she looks at little John the Baptist. The encounter of the two children has been mentioned in Tuscan devotional literature since the late 13th century. The cross is simultaneously a toy, an attribute of John the Baptist and a Passion symbol. The latter is also true of the conspicuously positioned poppy on the right. In the present painting, which was created at the beginning of his series of full-length Madonna depictions, Raphael decided on a strictly geometrical structure: the group is incorporated in an equilateral triangle. However, within the seemingly rigid structure, a lively scene unfolds. Parallel and opposing movements and glances blend with the landscape in the background to create a composition that is in keeping with the demands of the High Renaissance for perfect balance and harmony."}, {"title": "The Sistine Madonna", "artist": "Raphael", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-y8OFHWDH3nHwQfu8qnDCvRuBtBKhq2hAl4TZ4Agj-tPndoHwLdsXj4KECbAOO7a_HzErp", "desc": "The commission: The \"Sistine Madonna\" was almost certainly commissioned directly by Pope Julius II.

The \"Sistine Madonna\" was intended for the monastery church of San Sisto in Piacenza, with which the Pope was associated on account of close family contacts. Raphael had probably already been completed the work by the time of the Popes death in February 1513. The painting: The \"Sistine Madonna\" is one of the worlds most famous Renaissance masterpieces. It depicts a vision appearing to saints in the clouds. In the centre of the picture the Virgin strides towards the earthly realm whilst holding the Christ Child in her arms. Out of the expanse of the heavens, intimated by the countless heads of angels painted in sky blue, she carries the Christ Child into the world. Pope Sixtus II, a martyr from the third century, kneels on the left-hand side of the picture, showing her the way. On the right-hand side is the meekly kneeling figure of St. Barbara, who also suffered martyrdom in the third century. These two saints were venerated at the high altar of the monastery church of San Sisto in Piacenza, which is why the artist included them in the painting.

It is highly likely that he used the painting to demonstrate his mastery of this art. The drawn-back curtain opens a view of a room that is bathed in light from a window on the left (not visible in the picture). On the back wall is a detailed map of the Netherlands. In the foreground a chair and the table behind it, covered with various articles, direct the viewer\u2019s gaze to the middle distance. His back towards the viewer, the painter sits at his easel; he has begun work on a half-length portrait of the girl standing at the window. Thus painting occupies the most prominent place among the arts. The articles on the table represent sculpture (plaster cast), art printing (book) and tapestry weaving (fabrics). But what is the meaning of the model the artist is painting? The female figure is holding a trumpet and a book in her hands and is wearing a laurel wreath in her hair. Thus she is Clio, the Muse of history. Classical art theory considered history to be the primary subject of painting, but Vermeer subtly resists this doctrine, which in any case was almost irrelevant in the Dutch art market. With great painterly assertion, he raises this \u201cinferior\u201d interior to the ranks of highe start and lends this view of a painter\u2019s work the qualities of an allegory.

Upon completion of his training Rembrandt returned to Leiden. Around 1632 he moved to Amsterdam, quickly establishing himself as the town\u2019s leading artist. He received many commissions for portraits and attracted a number of students who came to learn his method of painting.Rembrandt painted, drew, and etched so many self-portraits in his lifetime that changes in his appearance invite us to gauge his moods by comparing one image to another. Such a biographical reading is encouraged by the way in which the artist confronts the viewer directly. Rembrandt painted this self-portrait in 1659, after he had suffered financial failure despite so many years of success. His spacious house on the Sint-Anthonisbreestraat and other possessions had been auctioned the previous year to satisfy his creditors. In this late work, the deep-set eyes that bore into those of the viewer seem to express inner strength and dignity.

She holds a brush in one hand and a palette in the other, cleverly identifying herself as the female personification of Painting - something her male contemporaries could never do. It was probably during her brief English sojourn (1638-c.1641) that Artemisia Gentileschi produced this painting. She was invited in 1638 by Charles I to come to London to join her father, Orazio Gentilieschi, who had been working in England since 1626. On one level the work depicts an allegorical figure of Painting, and was described as such in Charles Is inventory. Artemisia follows the standard emblematic handbook of the period, the Iconologia of Cesare Ripa, where Painting is described as a beautiful woman, with full black hair, dishevelled, and twisted in various ways, with arched eyebrows that show imaginative thought, the mouth covered with a cloth tied behind her ears, with a chain of gold at her throat from which hangs a mask, and has written in front imitation. Artemisia captures the essentials of this description, leaving out the inscription on the mask and the gagged mouth, intended to symbolise that Painting is dumb. With clothes of evanescently coloured drapery, she holds a brush in one hand and a palette in the other. The work is also, however, a self-portrait. There are precedents for this conflation of identities in representations of female artists. The portrait medal struck by Felice Antonio Casoni, celebrating the Cremonese painter Lavinia Fontana, depicts on the obverse a profile portrait of the artist, while on the reverse appears an allegory of Painting. Artemisia here fuses two established visual traditions within a single image. Few of Artemisias self-portraits survive and the references to them in the artists correspondence only hint at what others might have looked like. An engraving after a painted self-portrait of Artemisia by Jerome David, a bronze medal of 1625-8, and the portrait of her by Simon Vouet (Private Collection, Bergamo) are additional visual sources which may hint at her likeness. Her self-portrait has been identified in many other of her paintings, such as her Woman with Lute (Curtis Galleries, Minneapolis) and the recently attributed Self-portrait as a Female Martyr, and in many of her other religious paintings, which give some indication of how she represented herself. It is clear that Artemisias image was very much in demand among seventeenth-century collectors, who were attracted by her outstanding artistic abilities and her unusual status as a female artist. The Roman collector and antiquarian Cassiano del Pozzo was one of her strongest supporters. Writing to him in 1630, she notes: I have painted my portrait with the utmost care; in a later letter, she promises that she is sending my portrait, which you once requested. Some scholars have suggested that these two letters refer to the Royal Collection painting, which for some reason Artemisia never sent to Dal Pozzo, but instead brought with her to England. In 1630 she would have been in her mid-thirties, which corresponds with the apparent age in the present picture. However, it would have been be odd for Artemisia to break her promise to send the self-portrait mentioned in her letter to Cassiano dal Pozzo, one of her most prestigious patrons. Certain scholars have inclined to the view that the Cassiano self-portrait has been lost and that this is another, completed after Artemisias arrival in London in 1638 (when she was 46 years old). Artemisia wears a brown apron over her green dress and seems to be leaning on a stone slab used for grinding pigments in which the reflection of her left arm is visible. Underdrawing along her left arm may indicate where she marked out a position for her arm: quick, expert brushwork can be seen in the way in which she has depicted this arm as barely suggested. The area of brown behind her has been interpreted as background, or as a blank canvas on which she is about to paint. It looks like prepared canvas and was always thinly painted, but it is worn and may bear a closer resemblance than was the artists intention. She used the ground left exposed to suggest areas of shadow: particularly striking is the rolled-up sleeve of her right arm, where fluid strokes of white delineating the edge of her sleeve meet the brown shadow of exposed ground. The position of the fingers of her right hand are different in infra-red reflectography and x-radiography, suggesting that the artist was resolving this area as she worked, eventually lengthening the index finger. As a self-portrait the painting is particularly sophisticated and accomplished. The position in which Artemisia has portrayed herself would have been extremely difficult for the artist to capture, yet the work is economically painted, with very few pentiments. In order to view her own image she may have arranged two mirrors on either side of herself, facing each other. Depicting herself in the act of painting in this challenging pose, the angle and position of her head would have been the hardest to accurately render, requiring skilful visualisation.

Bewildered, Europa grasps the bulls horn, digs her fingers into his neck, and turns back to look at her companions on the waters edge. One young woman falls to the ground and raises her arms in alarm, dropping the flower garland intended for the bulls neck into her lap, while her friend clasps her hands in consternation and watches helplessly.

A medallion depicting Alexander the Great, whom Aristotle tutored, hangs from the gold chain. This extravagant decoration must be an award for service and recalls the gold chains that princely patrons gave to Titian, Rubens, and Van Dyck. It is generally supposed that Aristotle is contemplating the worth of worldly success as opposed to spiritual values. The gestures of the hands, accentuated by the cascading sleeves, and the shadows playing over Aristotles brow and eyes support this interpretation.  The picture was painted for the great Sicilian collector Antonio Ruffo, who evidently had not requested any particular subject. His inventory dated 1 September 1654 lists the canvas as \"half-length figure of philosopher made in Amsterdam by the painter named Rembrandt (it appears to be Aristotle or Albertus Magnus).\" The ancient and the medieval authors shared an interpretation in the senses, with sight (evoked by Homers blindness?) judged superior to hearing and touch. In the early 1660s Rembrandt sent Ruffo companion pictures of Alexander and Homer, which suggests that despite his much later costume the figure must be Aristotle (as he is called in Ruffo papers dated 1662). In any case, the study of a figure lost in thought is characteristic of Rembrandt, whose achievement here reflects his longstanding preoccupations with visual and emotional experience"}, {"title": "The Fortune Teller", "artist": " MMA", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-DbtvyNgZ06FtW-Nt29qT0OoVdSx_sFXZ9aM7kH88cE-DSc1bMt_UVb4aVa9GqvXeXonu6Qkg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Isaak zegent Jakob", "artist": "Flinck, Govert", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9WsMC32masLpOmHrgRPLIkVPst79wtOIEmhpToIDk969ZQsymST2GSzFhm3-XCtDXR_xwn", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Fortune-Teller", "artist": "Georges de La Tour", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9IeXPOWKVlHU0hpRSKkXBrASwqu-QSvJwn5hQ_bySpcPP8FG-Glzqa77m_mr99Fzbtsol5j_s", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Glass of Wine", "artist": "Jan Vermeer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-LM2kHbBfHHiZbdAJjnnMinsr3f0bv2R87k8n7xlAYNwGbeo4viGHE-n8_jwcHhyDGri_HRmk", "desc": "An elegantly dressed young man is watching a woman finish a glass of wine.

Indeed, the name of the artist was not correctly identified until 1866 by Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9. During the late seventeenth century the picture had been in collections in Delft, Vermeers home town, including that eventually sold on 16 May 1696 by Jacob Dissous which had 21 paintings by the artist - the largest group of such works assembled by a single individual. Lady at the Virginal was subsequently acquired by the Venetian artist, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, in 1718 either in Amsterdam or The Hague. Pellegrinis collection was bought by Consul Joseph Smith, who in turn sold his own collection to George III. By such a route did one of the greatest Dutch pictures in the Royal Collection arrive and to a certain extent the initial oversight regarding its importance has been more than adequately compensated for by the amount of scholarly attention that it now receives. Paintings by Vermeer - of which there are only 34 - are difficult to date and any chronology has to be based on an interpretation of style and complexity of composition. Lady at the Virginal was undoubtedly painted during the 1660s, but it is not possible to be more specific although there is at present a consensus of c.1662-4. The composition is characterised by the rigorous use of perspective to draw the eye towards the back of the room where the figures are situated - the young woman rather surprisingly seen from the back. The viewer is at first more aware of the jutting corner of the table, the chair and the bass viol than of the figures themselves, whose privacy is thereby protected. The back of the room, dominated by the virginal comparable with those made by Andreas Ruckers the Elder, is like a grid of verticals and horizontals into which the figures are carefully locked. Light is admitted through the windows on the left and fills the room, casting only soft, subtle shadows. A striking feature of the composition in this part is the mirror on the wall where the slightly blurred reflections include the young womans face, part of the table and the legs of an artists easel. The implication of this glimpsed easel is that Vermeer shares the same space as the figures he is depicting, but as a result of this artifice he is also, like the viewer, standing outside that space. In fact, as Alpers has observed, Vermeers composition is based on exclusion. Many of the elements, particularly at the back of the room, are seen only partially, as though indicating the appearance of the world as ungraspable. The inscription on the lid of the virginal, MUSICA LETITIAE CO[ME]S / MEDICINA DOLOR[IS], means Music is a companion in pleasure and a balm in sorrow. It suggests that it is the relationship between the man and the young woman that is being explored by the artist, but what stage that relationship has reached is impossible to say. The fact that there are two musical instruments implies shared pleasures and a potential harmony, which is also indicated by the rapt expression on the mans face as he listens to the young woman or sings as she plays on the virginal. That some aspect of love is the presiding theme can be deduced not only from paintings by Vermeers contemporaries, such as Metsu, but also by the presence in Lady at the Virginal of the picture of Roman Charity (Cimon and Pero) by Dirck van Baburen on the wall in the background on the right. This is the story of how the imprisoned Cimon was nourished by his daughter Pero, symbolising the ideal of Christian charity both physically and spiritually. It is known that Vermeers mother-in-law, Maria Thins, owned such a painting and Vermeer did use another painting by this artist in the background of two of his other pictures. The vase on the table is placed below Roman Charity and so with regard to that picture may be an additional correlative for the young people in the room. The mood of the present interior by Vermeer is created as much by the careful selection of so few objects as by the confrontation of the two figures in whose plight, in the words of Lawrence Gowing, there rests, as gentle as the air itself, an allegory of liberty and bondage, an allegory, as the inscription informs us, of the pleasure and melancholy of love.

But I feared the pride, the plague of nobility [\u2026], and thus I liked the idea of taking a wife who does not blush when she sees me pick up a brush.\u201d (Rubens in a letter to his friend Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc.) In December 1630, the 53-year-old Rubens married the 16-year-old daughter of the Antwerp silkmerchant Daniel Fourment. Even Rubens\u2019s closest friends did not refrain from alluding to the great age difference between the bride and groom. His first wife, Isabella Brandt, had died of the plague in 1626. The traditional title of the painting, \u201cher pelzken\u201d (\u201cThe Little Fur\u201d), comes from Rubens himself, who bequeathed the work to his young wife as a private gift. She never sold the painting; it was inherited by her children and is not documented in the inventory of the Picture Gallery before 1730. Helena\u2019s sensual body is covered only partially by a dark fur robe, which is depicted in all its beauty. She seems to be stepping slightly to the left, while her torso remains at rest. The posture of her arms is no coincidence: it resembles the classical type of the Venus Pudica \u2013 bashful concealment or coquettish suggestion \u2013 the effect remains open. The red of the fabric on which she is standing corresponds gently with her slightly pink skin to intensify again in her reddened cheeks and sensual lips. Thus Rubens goes beyond the pure portrait genre: the image of Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, resonates in the painting. In addition he is quoting from the work of a great colleague: shortly before the creation of the present painting, Rubens had the opportunity to see Titian\u2019s Girl in a Fur (KHM, GG 89) in the collection of the English king and copy it.

In presenting \u201claughing but didactic\u201d contents, Jordaens is also assimilating modern Dutch influences: in the Protestant Netherlands moralising genrepaintings \u2013 always, however, in small format \u2013 were much more highly esteemed than in Catholic Flanders.

The source of Titian\u2019s painting was Flavius Philostratus the Younger\u2019s Eikones, in which the ancient writer described 64 pictures of an imaginary (?) Neapolitan gallery, including the Gods of Love by an anonymous painter. Twenty years after his study of the Italian model, Rubens began a painting on the same subject but expanded the repertoire of figures in his dynamic composition. Venus, the goddess of love, is the centre of attention. The posture of her arms is in keeping with the classical type of the Venus Pudica, which is characterised by its ambivalence: bashful concealment can also become its opposite \u2013 the effect on the viewer remains open. Elevated to monumental status, Venus is surrounded by numerous cupids, dancing and caressing each other and creating an appropriate setting for the feast in the tree-tops above her. Four women devote themselves to the marble cult figure: Venus is being washed, the smell of incense fills the summery air, and, finally, a precious mirror is raised to the goddess. The group around Bacchus, the god of wine, on the left in the foreground as well as the procession of Satyrs and Maenads on the right at the back are embellishments by Rubens.

The synthesis that Van Dyck achieved in the portrait was described by the nineteenth-century artist Sir David Wilkie: the simplicity of inexperience shows them in most engaging contrast with the power of their rank and station, and like the infantas of Velasquez, unite all the demure stateliness of the court, with the perfect artlessness of childhood. George IIIs admiration for the early Stuarts and the aesthetic of Charles Is court was reflected in this purchase and he hung many of his finest Van Dycks in Buckingham House. However, eighteenth-century attitudes towards childhood, which was increasingly regarded as a distinct, innocent phase of life, are reflected in many of the portraits of George IIIs children. George IIIs taste for Van Dyck might have been sparked by that of his father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, who had a high regard for the collection of Charles I and had purchased Van Dycks double portrait of Thomas Killigrew and William, Lord Crofts, in 1748. Similarly, George IVs interest in the later Stuarts, and his attempts to reclaim items associated with the exiled dynasty, may equally have been inspired by his father.

The ferocious creature--seemingly undaunted by a pair of hounds latched onto its bristled hide--has turned to confront head-on its human adversary. Meleagers blow will prove to be fatal to the boar, but the beast has proven itself as a fearsome foe. Beneath its imposing hooves lie the disemboweled carcass of a hound and the prostrate corpse of the hunter Ancaeus.The story of the Calydonian boar hunt was told and retold during antiquity--most famously in Ovids Metamorphoses. When King Oeneus of Calydon failed to honor the goddess Diana with offerings, she released a terrifying boar on his land. The kings son, Meleager, assembled a group of renowned warriors to slay the beast. Several of the huntsmen were killed or maimed before Meleager finally defeated the boar. He presented its head as a trophy to his beloved, the huntress Atalanta, who is seen behind Meleager, with bow in hand.Peter Paul Rubens created this painting a few years after an extended stay in Italy. He drew from ancient sarcophagi and statues he had seen there for the poses of many of the figures. For example, the boar seen in profile was taken directly from a well-known marble in Florences Uffizi Gallery. Rubenss appropriation of iconic images from antiquity was intended to resonate with learned viewers. For the figures on horseback, Rubens borrowed from his Renaissance predecessors, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael. But Rubenss dynamic and inventive interpretation of the hunt was wholly his own.

The hesitating figure of Lot is shown in the center with his wife seen in profile to his left and his two daughters, trying to carry their riches with them, behind him to the right. They are shown in a gloomy unsettled scene as Lot abandons his position in the town in accordance with an order from God. The pillar seen in the central back section of the composition prefigures the fate of Lots wife, who is turned into a pillar of salt when she looks back at the city.There are three other known works that have essentially the same dimensions and composition as this work (Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida; Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach, Florida; Private collection). A comparison of the details of these works was thought to be a good method of clarifying Rubenss studio methods, and thus in the summer of 1993 a study exhibition entitled The Flight of Lot and his Family from Sodom: Rubens and his Workshop was held at the NMWA. The exhibition brought together the NMWA work alongside the two oil paintings from the Bass and Ringling museums, a reproduction engraving of the composition by Lucas Vorsterman, and preparatory sketches for the engraving. The details of the works were surveyed during the exhibition, opinions were exchanged by specialists from the NMWA and other institutions, and the following was clarified. In spite of the fact that the Ringling work includes some student work in its secondary elements, it is overwhelmingly superior in quality and can be considered an original work by Rubens. The Bass work is probably a studio work based on the Ringling work. The NMWA painting has more stereotyped expression in such areas as the beards and angel wings, sections that would have allowed a masters talents to shine, and thus it is thought that the NMWA work is a studio work created under the direction of Rubens. However, in many areas the NMWA work differs from the Ringling painting. Thus, while not yet confirmed, the theory regarding the NMWA work that has the greatest support today is R-A. dHulsts view that this painting was from the earliest period of Jacob Jordaens, a young collaborator of Rubens, particularly based on the vigorous depiction of the bodies and the cool, pale lavender tones used in the work.

Once in the room, the viewer is confronted by a host of vanitas objects: a lute with a broken string, a skull intertwined with a vine, a candle with the flame extinguished, and a jewellery box with its lid wide open. These all signify the transient effects of misdirected sensual pleasure. Even the act of pulling on a stocking had a clear message which is found in the emblem book by Roemer Visscher, Sinnepoppen (1614): namely that impetuous behaviour such as pulling on a stocking too quickly could result in its being holed, just as yielding to sensuality could lead to ruin. Steen implies that to pass through the arch would be to risk the loss of virtue. There is, therefore, a sense in which the interior amounts to pagan love and the exterior to spiritual love. The artists ingenuity does not end with the images, but extends to word play: the Dutch word for stocking (kous) used as slang meant fornication and the Dutch word for chamber pot (piespot) used in conjunction with kous (i.e. pieskous) was in slang a pejorative word for women. Similarly, to appreciate the significance of the artists signature on the column it is necessary to realise that steen in Dutch means stone. On a technical basis, the quality of the painting is remarkable for the treatment of the light, particularly in the room itself, and in the meticulous depiction of the still-life objects (the bed, the floor, the ceiling, the chandelier) and the foreshortening of the door. Woman at her Toilet was in private collections in Amsterdam and Brussels during the second half of the 18th century. It was acquired by George IV in 1821. A variant of the composition from c.1659-60 in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, emphasises the narrative elements and eschews allegory.

Judging from the ages of the children, this work is thought to have been painted around 1612/1613. Rubens later used the faces of these two children in large-scale paintings in oils, respectively the Madonna in Floral Wreath (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) and the Madonna and the Angels (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris).\tThis work is a study work, revealing the freshness found in sketching directly from a subject, and yet it is a superb example of the artists inimitable brush, particularly in the truly touchable depiction of the rich fleshiness of the childrens cheeks. This is an example of Rubenss uncanny ability to evoke an image of his subject through an adroit use of transparent pigments and opaque pigments, adjustments of light and dark tonalities and differences in the thickness of paint application.

David found shelter by the stone Ezel, where their last meeting took place.

The theme of love and suffering which lies at the heart of the biblical story is captured with amazing force in the painting.

Brueghel studied and drew many of these animals from life. With the discovery of the New World in the 1600s came an increased curiosity about natural history.

Castigliones friezelike composition, with figures balanced carefully along the foreground plane in front of a classical architectural backdrop, reflects the influence of fellow Baroque artist Nicolas Poussin, whose circle Castiglione frequented in Rome.   Oil sketches emerged in the 1500s as a step in the preparation of a painting, but Castiglione was among the earliest artists to make them as independent, finished works of art. Castiglione \"drew\" with the brush in oils, using little color and thus conveying the effect of a drawing rather than a painting.

He was a shareholder in the Dutch East India Company and from 1620 their master shipbuilder; both were Roman Catholics. He is shown working on what looks like a treatise on shipbuilding rather than a specific design, with inscriptions on the various papers naming the sitter, the artist and the date, 1633. The only object not immediately identifiable is the instrument for drawing the curving planks running lengthways down a ships hull. Married couples are usually shown at this date as two separate portraits, with the husband hung to the left (as we look at it, that is on the wifes right hand), often with some gestures or glances linking the two. Rembrandt has created a composition as if these two portraits are run together into a single image. This means that the figures overlap and their interaction is more vivid: we are to imagine that Griet Jans has burst into the room (her hand still on the door), interrupting her husband with a message which seems to her (if not to him) of the utmost urgency. Everything about her expresses breathless anxiety; he seems simply irritated. We must imagine that there is a sort of apposite comedy in this presentation which the sitters recognised, acknowledged and enjoyed. The image could also be read as a writer inspired by his Muse. This belongs to a time when Rembrandt was most successful and fashionable as a portrait painter. His art was also at its most naturalistic, especially in the depiction of textures and surfaces, which are here described in great fidelity, neither glossing over nor revelling in the leathery, weather-beaten skin and white, tobacco-stained hair of his ancient sitters. At this date and subsequently Rembrandt experimented with a metaphorical deployment of light, suggesting human warmth or spirituality rather than observable phenomena. This can be seen especially in his Old Woman of 1630. By contrast the light here is almost completely natural, flooding the space from the window visible at the left edge, catching each form at exactly the angle and revealing its detail and texture. It is this natural light which is developed by Rembrandts pupil, Gerrit Dou, as can be seen in his Girl Chopping Onions of 1647 (RCIN 406358)"}, {"title": "Portrait of Olivia Boteler Porter", "artist": "Anthony Van Dyck", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-AF6oEuYdV763ni7HAv2Rk7vUcMSTw5NBwoL9ADYFyHLJzby59d-aQ-xl_lEC8-eUQ-1lFtQ", "desc": "This portrait was formerly thought to represent Queen Henrietta Maria.

Among them, we see a peasant pushing a barrow containing vegetables, a pancake maker wiping her child\u2019s bottom, and a fish merchant, blithely unaware that she is being robbed of her purse. The scene is set just outside the walls of the painter\u2019s hometown, Leiden. Dou portrayed himself as well, leaning out of a window with a palette in his hand. He would surely have had a reason for placing himself beside the quack. Perhaps his idea was that both are masters of illusion: the bogus doctor deceives by selling useless remedies, the artist by suggesting a reality which is merely paint on a panel"}, {"title": "Pastoral Landscape with a Mill", "artist": "Claude Lorrain", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM99LxzFundCVt3DMibRYD3jSwobL3k87csIIztsPPAbackHGevUa61vYUiCEOWD0-hzAeTA_g", "desc": null}, {"title": "Still Life with Lobster and Fruit", "artist": "Abraham van Beyeren", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9YEt5XkdKNQwkBqDcBcgHF4Cd_WbSY011D-Jz7-OeTd0HNp6-_PBeIHdOtlhelv183ri2HuQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Still-Life with Flowers", "artist": "Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM92JTNx1MfwvX8QQJipUljuFnKjTpQ0EMKhBMDkdMbe1SgtRIB_OqxXTCzvoO7OSqX6yC7hwDgR", "desc": "Bosschaert seldom varied his compositions, no doubt relying upon the customer\u00b4s great demand for flower pieces.

Only after the death of his friend Patroclus did Achilles become reconciled with Agamemnon and return to the Greek army. This oil sketch is the fourth in a series of eight oil sketches which Rubens made about the life of Achilles in preparation for a series of tapestries. Rubens designed four series of tapestries, and all four were executed. That was an expensive and time-consuming procedure in which oil sketches like these were just the first step. They were followed by larger painted models, which preceded full-size cartoons for the weaver which were ten times the size of the initial sketches and were typically painted by assistants. It is hard to imagine that a project of that kind could be undertaken without a patron, but in three of the four cases we do not know who this was. The last series was made around 1630, and all eight of sketches have survived. Seven are in Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. They chronicle the life of the Greek hero Achilles from his baptism in the Stynx, one of the legendary rivers of the underworld.

In 1621 Rubens supplied Lord Danvers with Lion Hunt (now lost), a studio work, not knowing that it was intended for Charles, Prince of Wales. Danvers had it sent back as a peese scarse touched by his own hand. Rubens seems to have planned with Lord Danvers to make a peace offering to the Prince the moment he realised his mistake. Later Rubens claimed that he was concerned at the arrogance of sending a self-portrait under these circumstances: it did not seem fitting to send my portrait to a prince of such high rank, but he overcame my modesty (Rubens, letter of 10 January 1625; to Palam\u00e8de de Fabri, Sieur de Valavez; 1582 - 1645). The most important thing, however, was that the work should be executed by Rubens and not his assistants: Lord Danvers wrote to William Trumbull in Brussels, asking for his owne picture made originall and every part of it wrought with his owne hand (letter of 18 December 1622). Danvers adds in the same letter that this is a self-portrait which I heare hee hath made alreadie; it is difficult to know if this means that Rubens redirected an existing (obviously recent) self-portrait, or whether enough progress had been made on the portrait which Danvers himself instigated (through some previous, now lost, instruction) for word to get out that it was made alreadie. Whatever the explanation, the portrait is signed and dated 1623 and seems to have arrived in London in that year. This is an interesting piece of self-promotion; it does not advertise Rubenss invention, figure drawing or story-telling, important elements of his art. Instead we see purely pictorial qualities at their most intense: contrast of light and dark, with shades of deep black and a softly luminous face; strong accents of colour on the face and sky (again contrasting with the areas of black); variations of paint application from thinly scrubbed areas in the background, where brown underpaint shows through, to the thick, mobile rivers of oil paint, drawn by the brush, over the face. Rubenss owne hand is obviously and everywhere at work. The objects in the background of this portrait could be described as a rock and a reddening sky, which, in Latin, would read, Petrus et caelum rubens. It has been suggested that the artist included them as a play on his own name (reinforcing the Latin signature), or indeed that the whole portrait depicts a shame-faced, blushing or rubens Rubens.

This large composition, which combines a powerful tragic story with a daring composition, is typical of Rubenss voluptuous style, developed after his return from his Italian sojourn during the first decade of the seventeenth century. It is a superb example of the work of this artist and homo universalis.  The paintings famous mythological subject is based on the account of Adoniss death in Ovids Metamorphoses. Rubens chose to depict the tragic moment when Venus discovers the body of her young, handsome lover after his fatal encounter with the wild boar that left him bleeding to death.   Combining Classical as well as Flemish stylistic motifs, the painting is full of pathos and passion. Rubens enhances the tragic scene with the presence of the three weeping Graces and the sobbing Cupid who, with the grieving Venus, replicate a Pieta scene.

During his trip to Valladolid he had to endure a horrible trip under constant rain that damaged some paintings. To substitute some of them, Rubens painted this canvas representing philosophers Democritus and Heraclitus. Both refer, by their line of thought and way of life, to opposite human temperaments: Democritus, bon viveur and optimistic and Heraclitus, dark in his writings, melancholic and not very tolerant. Rubens is going to portray them looking at the spectator, leaning towards an Earth globe where we can see northern Europe and the oceans around it. Democritus with a cheerful face and a symbolic red cloak, indicates Heraclitus, with somber gesture and black robes. The panting shows the typical features of the baroque painting: the speed of the brush-stroke, the ardent colors, and the pomposity of shapes or the theatrical composition. Until the beginning of the 19th century the work stayed within the descendants of the Duke of Lerma, from where it went to private English collections until 1999, when the Spanish government bought it from the auctions house Christies of London"}, {"title": "Portrait of The Comtesse de La Fayette (Marie-Madeleine Pioche De la Vergne)", "artist": "Nicolas Mignard", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9FWqImRFHVurD7RF7wnMCX4LDA2wZlF9oQyYG-U2NQ5octysr_g5z4ZAaOl6ljHt1sNbe9DwSm", "desc": "Known primarily for his early paintings of religious scenes and altarpieces, Avignon-based artist Nicolas Mignard was also commissioned to paint numerous portraits of members of the court of King Louis XIV.

Rubens made use of a treatment known to the Flemish by depicting the Bacchanalian celebration as the last feast of nature before the winter sleep. The gross bodies of old Silenus, Bacchuss teacher, goat-footed satyrs and fat satyresses in Rubens painting resemble over-ripe autumn fruit that has soaked up all lifes juices. The figures form an ellipse so that the celebration seems to repeat itself endlessly, like the eternal renewal of nature full of ebullient life-creating forces.In Rome Rubens saw an antique sarcophagus with Bacchanalian scenes, which subsequently entered the collection of Cardinal Altempis, and made drawings of it when painting his \"Bacchanalia\". By a stroke of good fortune the sarcophagus was brought in 1843 by Count S. S. Uvarov and is now on display in the same museum as Rubens painting (see Room 4)"}, {"title": "The Feast of Herod", "artist": "Peter Paul Rubens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_TTW0KL097Q9P2YSMo_iS7238XgMXa1x-VcB2MWYb4O3D9zzW7weOY54SRKUXVYUT8Gv-vtg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Titus van Rijn, the Artist\u2019s Son, Reading", "artist": "Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_It9c0v_xyYKMkXXKK6pgel0OB-xbR_p6dOEFkoNtaY7Y0AVJGo0hIYMPuCS2sLXWq9FuXtOY", "desc": "Titus was born in 1641, the fourth child of the painter and his first wife, Saskia, and the only one to reach adulthood. After 1659, he and his father\u2019s mistress, Hendrickje Stoffels, ran Rembrandt\u2019s business, the father having lost his fortune because of his lavish lifestyle and a bad investment about which the archives do not provide adequate information. A court had previously found the artist to be legally incompetent. The son died, however, in 1668, a year before his father. Titus is seated in an armchair, intently reading a book he holds in his hands. His mouth is slightly open, suggesting great focus of attention and giving the scene a subtle immediacy. He appears relaxed, his full attention turned away from the viewer. The light is concentrated on his forehead, hands and book, further strengthening the intimate immediacy of the moment. Rembrandt often used his son as a model.

Although he painted many biblical subjects, which helped to create a new Protestant iconography, the majority of his pictures are portraits. For ten years after he settled in Amsterdam in 1631/32, the prosperous burgher class flocked to him for portraits painted in carefully detailed style. In contrast, many of his later, more penetrating portraits were not commissioned, being studies of his family or of his Jewish neighbours. The sitter of this late portrait has not been conclusively identified, although it has been suggested that she is Magdalena van Loo, Rembrandts young daughter-in-law. Posed against a dark, indefinite background, a device Rembrandt used to great effect, the young, rather plain woman stares pensively into space. The introspection of her demeanor contrasts sharply with the outward splendor of her dress, which creates a deeply compelling yet enigmatic image"}, {"title": "Portrait of Moliere", "artist": "Pierre Mignard", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8W9onHo_ytW2qfVasqiT025_upDTAcS5S0267K_Iv1Gqs3VB9kD3urBovEEOpK75u7xrgEUw", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Cat Stealing Fish", "artist": "Giuseppe Recco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-4s_tElBY5rJ21xWJYNKWR0nSQ-JqhTNdEMerjS-rH_MCe6m8nUYZO6jNX1gv2c9G4VCPX0eM", "desc": null}, {"title": "Roses, Convolvulus, Poppies, and Other Flowers in an Urn on a Stone Ledge", "artist": "Rachel Ruysch", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_qxHwz6hEavd6BFTlIbRtwwMKLf2kEC5fMTjYd58DM5L-ywEIIUYpQICfj6db2_ryPJVWAkgCV", "desc": "The exuberant profusion of flowers in this still life by Rachel Ruysch celebrates color, texture, and form.

the Sea, to the Nereid (sea nymph) Amphitrite; the painting is part of the more general subject of the Sea Triumph.

Neptune is carrying his characteristic trident, while Amphitrite is individualized and set off from the other Nereids by her accessories and regal bearing.

relatively rare in the 17th century, measured by the number of glorifying portraits of rulers and generals and battle scenes.

An example of this genre is this picture, which drastically illustrates the brutality with which the Soldateska (band of soldiers) took action against the simple rural population: an unarmed man is pushed to the ground by a soldier who is just about to sting with his sword, surrounded by two desperate women. A man escapes, but a musketeer has already fired a shot at him. In the middle of the room lies a slain man, further behind a soldier threatens a woman.

It is certainly no coincidence that the various items of food in the painting represent the four flavours: the apples are sour, the nuts bitter, the cheeses salt and the grapes sweet.

Two items of dairy products on top of one another, usually butter and cheese, were seen as extravagance.

For a long time experts were divided on whether to ascribe it to Rubens or to Van Dyck. The latest investigations into the paint layering appear to support the museum, which has always considered Rubens as the author. It is easy to understand the popularity of this work. The masterly painting technique \u2013 free, virtuoso and rhythmic \u2013 is easy to read. The human subject matter, without any barrier of complicated mythology or religious themes, speaks to us directly. The whiff of exoticism in the living representation of a man from a distant country tempts some, the dignified treatment of a member of a frequently discriminated racial group wins over others, and a third group of viewers rejoices at this picture of a human being full of apparently uncomplicated joie de vivre. Rubens would perhaps be surprised at the special predilection for this work of his. It is certain that he also gave this sketch the full force of his artistic ability. Added to this, he took the technique of the oil paint sketch, developed earlier in Italy, to unknown artistic heights, as in the unique series of designs for the Torre de la Parada which are found in the Brussels museum collection. Rubens made sure that his sons would have such studies should they themselves want to become painters. But ultimately this type of facial study was intended for inclusion in much more ambitious compositions. Such telling observations from various angles were particularly suited to multiple, and hence highly economic, use in a very wide variety of paintings. The same head reappears for example in the Adoration of the Magi, also conserved in the museum, but then as the head of a turbaned wise man in the middle ground: here he is organically included in a detailed and monumental altarpiece, which today elicits much less enthusiasm and attention"}, {"title": "Een vrouw met een kind in een kelderkamer", "artist": "Hooch, Pieter de", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9R6oV8rnFN06IKaupopoFQQAH7hG0teyw8a-rAPzIHTjj24QgRo3WLiziR3bdYmWwBRgtB3iYV", "desc": "Pieter de Hooch werkte een paar jaar lang gelijktijdig met Johannes Vermeer in Delft.

The massive column in the shadows (also a reference to the artist\u2019s Stoic ideals, which have often been documented), the leather gloves and the left hand resting on a sword: these are all attributes of a courtly portrait. The composition is dominated by dark tones; the only bright accents are the slightly reddish face, the pleated collar and the left hand. A powerful curve leads from Rubens\u2019s right hand across his body and left shoulder to the large dark collar, which extends almost threateningly far beyond the line of his back. Rubens concentrates most of the light in the dark-grey background. His wide-brimmed hat finally provides a compositional counterweight and closes off the painting at the top. Although Rubens had been raised to the nobility by the Spanish monarch and knighted by the king of England, his decision to depict himself as a member of the aristocracy is nonetheless surprising: he had repeatedly distanced himself from life at court. In the final years of his life, he had largely freed himself from the responsibilities of a man of the court and diplomat, dividing his time between his city residence in Antwerp and his country castle near Elewijt. Due to serious attacks of gout, he was sometimes unable to perform even the simplest tasks. His sensitive face reflects something of his bodily ills but also the serenity of the 62-year-old artist. The fact that he painted one of the most sensual portraits of his young wife, Helena Fourment (KHM, GG 688), at about the same time adds a not unimportant aspect to our understanding of the artist\u2019s personal situation at the time."}, {"title": "Euclid", "artist": "Jusepe de Ribera", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9UuDSvzbQ2Sf_6Z58duM1Saxs7vUSJIsPxpGwELCU1bSDD30CMdYZI_LQH8SNtqMvUUpFmwrw", "desc": "Emerging from deep shadows behind a table, a solemn individual stands displaying a well-worn book with various geometric figures, pseudo-Greek characters, and an imaginary script.

The lemon - an exotic, expensive fruit in the 17th century - gives it a dazzling touch. This still life is a superb example of Dutch realism. But it may still contain a hidden message. The half-full Rummer could symbolize the virtues of moderation, whereas the one lying in shatters on the plate with oysters would seem to be a warning against leading a sinful life. In the 17th century oysters were associated with frequenting brothels and intemperance.

As advisor to the Roman troops during the siege of Jerusalem (70 AD), he tried in vain to prevent the plundering and destruction of the Temple. Even Titus, the Roman commander and son of the emperor, could not stop his troops from doing so. Flavius Josephus later (75 \u2013 79 AD) wrote a seven-volume history of the Jewish War (De bello Judaico) on which this depiction is based. Poussin came to Rome in 1624, and only a short stay in Paris (1640\u20131642) was to interrupt his Roman career. As a friend of his successful fellow-painter Claude Lorrain and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Pope Urban VIII and the cultured members of the papal court, Poussin became one of Rome\u2019s most prominent painters. His frequently documented interest in the art of antiquity gave his works a classical touch, which manifests itself in the present painting in its relief-like composition and plain coloration. The chaotic action appears well-organised, with the bodies precisely laid out on the canvas, and the mighty columns of the temple and the rigid figures in the foreground providing a counterweight to the battlefield tumult. The picture was created on a commission from Cardinal Francesco Barberini and presented by an imperial envoy to Emperor Ferdinand III as a gift from the Pope in 1639. It remains uncertain what the Pope hoped to achieve in choosing the subject: was it an admonishing reminder of the conquest and plundering of Mantua by imperial troops in 1627? Or was it late praise?

Paulus Potter, the finest Dutch animal painter of his day, described the horse with scrupulous attention to physical detail: the glossy sheen of its coat and mane, the watery moistness of its eye, and the sleekly elegant lines of the animals body. At the same time, the artist imbued the horse with an individualized personality that combines wildness with acute sensitivity. Indeed, the animal seems to respond to the distant sound of the hunt transpiring in the middle distance.  The meaning of the painting is twofold. It is probably a horse portrait, perhaps commissioned by the owner of the country house at the right. The closely observed rendering of this domestic animal implies the pride of ownership that a wealthy Dutch landowner might have taken in the possession of such livestock. On the other hand, the horse is untethered and seems to roam free.

Iconographically this composition is extremely rare. Unlike most views of David, boasting of his victory after vanquishing Goliath the giant, here David is shown in a very subdued state, in an introspective moment where he thanks God for his victory. The dark blue used in the background was a color characteristic of Guercinos works at this time, and it was a darkened version of lapis lazuli, a pigment traditionally closely linked to God and heaven. The use of this pigment evokes the internal conundrum of David caused by his spectacular victory. This painting was popular from the time of its creation and there are two extant copies of the work painted by Guercinos students. This is the best example of the Bolognese school during the Italian Baroque era in the NMWA collection.

The sky and clouds that spread above this open plane are filled with an Italianate clarity, providing an interesting contrast to the skies seen in the works of Lorrains contemporary, van Goyen (see cat. no. 35).\tLorrain collected a large number of sketches recording his own compositions in an album entitled Liber Veritatis (British Museum, London), and number 108 (1646-47) of these drawings repeats this same composition. From this evidence it has been concluded that this work was created under commission from the wealthy Lyonnaise merchant and humanist, Philippe Silvestre Dufourt. Lorrain rarely depicted this theme of satyrs and nymphs, indicating that Dufourt particularly requested this subject.

This did not go unnoticed by his pursuers, and they promised Delilah a large amount of silver if she could find out where in his great strength lay. Upon her questioning, he lied to her three times and his capture failed, but Delilah did not give up, reminding him that their love vow did not permit secrets. Finally, he told her the truth and revealed the connection between his power and his hair. \u201cAnd she made him sleep upon her knees [\u2026] and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head. [\u2026] and his strength went from him. [\u2026] And he awoke [\u2026] and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him. But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza [\u2026] and he did grind in the prison house.\u201d (Judges 16:19\u201321.) Van Dyck used several artistic sources for the present painting: one detail of the scene \u2013 Samson\u2019s desperately grasping the leg of the traitress \u2013 is borrowed from a work by Titian.

The figure of Juno connects the two, depicted in the main scene as being surrounded by other gods of Olympus. Here, the goddess is indicating France\u2019s three enemy powers to highlight their vanity, of which she is the allegory. In his depiction of these powers, Charles Le Brun has observed a certain hierarchy of the crowns. The Holy Roman Empire is in the centre overlooking the others. Slightly below on the Empire\u2019s right is Spain, who is wearing a crown that is not closed, indicating the sovereignty of the kingdom, and is therefore not equal to the French monarchy. Beneath her she is crushing a sovereign, while the lion she is sitting on is devouring another who has been overthrown on top of his treasure. She is pointing to the scene on the left, where Ambition is tearing a crown from the \u2018King of the Indies\u201d, and setting light to a destroyed palace with a torch, representing the ravages caused by Spain\u2019s rapacity and excessive ambition in the American colonies. On the Empire\u2019s left is the Dutch Republic, positioned a little lower than Spain with a simple count\u2019s crown, indicating the inferiority of a Republic. The allegory is sitting on bundles of goods signifying the trade on which the State thrived. In her left hand she is holding Neptune\u2019s trident and the chains binding Tethys to show that she dominates the seas to boost her trade. The term \u201cprosperity\u201d replaced \u201cpride\u201d in the inscription in the 18th century, also leading to the loss of the composition\u2019s initial meaning: the pride of the Empire, Spain and the Dutch Republic justified France\u2019s declaration of war against them"}, {"title": "Landscape with Peasants Playing Bowls Outside an Inn", "artist": "David Teniers the Younger", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-1L8LQep42pJrhr3k99oKpBqXRQS1F6lEJwR33TfjbrEI1iRca3K1JZgVF2agSG1t0rQOzEvx_", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Young Woman at Her Toilet with a Maid", "artist": "Gerard ter Borch", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8NnJ61zSIx3dMy0N7LiShFDxT1-VAu0jwr-LHoXJ7uzXVUpZ5KlNG0cN8m3hro18IVO7qm2UQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Triumph of Pan", "artist": "Nicolas Poussin", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-PfGGqNNuysmC5FIowElvueckbTsJ98JcieCT2ZoMIhNyawXeLrZWwJITAggvWtJKmh1UbTA", "desc": "Poussin was the greatest classicising painter of the 17th century. He was born in Normandy but travelled to Italy at around the age of thirty and, excepting a short and disaffected return to Paris in 1640-41, he spent the rest of his life in Rome. His paintings were mostly executed for private collectors and are replete with scholarly references; avidly sought after by his countrymen, they were instrumental in the development of classicism in France. The drawing corresponds in its details, though not in its proportions, with one of a pair of Bacchanals painted for the French Minister of State, Cardinal Richelieu, dispatched from Rome in May 1636 and now in the National Gallery, London. The function of the drawing is, however, puzzling. As the painting was destined for a specific setting, Poussin had surely been provided with its required dimensions - almost square - and such a carefully drawn sheet is not a sketch in which the artist can neglect the proportions of the final piece. The provenance of the sheet also rules out the possibility that this was a model sent to Richelieu for his approval. Perhaps the sheet was a by-product of the commission, drawn for one of Poussins erudite friends in Rome; it could then in principle have been executed after the painting, though the richness and fluency of the wash would place it close in date. The Royal Collections holdings of drawings by Poussin are second in number only to those in the Louvre, and are mostly in excellent condition. They came to England in two albums, both probably assembled during the artists lifetime. One, which included the Triumph of Pan, was put together by Poussins pupil, friend and patron Cardinal Camillo Massimi (1620-77). In 1739, Massimis descendants sold the album to Richard Mead, physician to King George II and a notable collector, and Mead sold or (more likely) gave the album to Frederick, Prince of Wales. The second album was described in the Albani library by Johann Joachim Winckelmann in 1759, and was thus purchased by George III with the Albani collection three years later. The origins of that album are not certain, but it was probably compiled by Poussins greatest patron, Cassiano dal Pozzo"}, {"title": "Circe straft Glaucus door Scylla in een monster te veranderen", "artist": "Neer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-5c4VYuyq16PWi5BJ31i8Gs8MyPuv8ghyjF7GNaRP7PMrym_J-jXKnFL3FPPC85OQe2rjX", "desc": null}, {"title": "Groenendael Abbey", "artist": "Wenceslaus Hollar", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM93FsUsl1GII-5dKi-nohk0tA1kUu5glzEeINTcWytambTiraqkDvOyGSx64rEAX3zLp-bIJig", "desc": null}, {"title": "IJdelheid (Superbia)", "artist": "Vorsterman, Lucas (I", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-9tb42CblhnIuPoWrO59VwI610l4XYbOQvOXWGzXP8ibxC7BMu3MIztmKVMiAodchxQPG63j0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Louis XV (1710\u20131774) as a Child", "artist": "Hyacinthe Rigaud", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9KtXJMMl_uYXAqPl3KeGxpNIsCQoG_oKyqGBdB_7nvF8FC--Mo1Qv2wrILg17Ju_i8YhWFn1A", "desc": null}, {"title": "Flora", "artist": "Oil on Canvas", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9V1qZO24cmTjbCWV6JVB_Mcp98GBBNLNa5LMmB-6stmWYk5nhlyHKu-6QHGnC83f1KHJsJPw", "desc": "French painter Claude Vignon was much in demand, particularly at the Paris court of Louis XIII and in ecclesiastical circles"}, {"title": "The Feast of the Pharisees", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_2aO9_L2Q_qn-p96FfgiNv7HGa7zxGTx7FuAtpVQ4gZxoBvKbtGO60eYWxUzaiknYVOOYkxQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "De troepen van Ferdinando I de' Medici bestormen een stadspoort", "artist": "Callot, Jacques", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-v7Rm2ykGUmmdcy4ZAZAJcxBEt2kIOyHaPTD3ZTHpJcLQEQy_ii8hyFN3s55HFaEdWkliT6zU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Still Life with Musical Instruments", "artist": "Cristoforo Munari", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-JN_MA3zla-kWjQ4XKNZE0pQD7EcAaz-XGLDRt3a6OGmxMUN6SrsMJMEQVaiFo3j84kOeSgmEu", "desc": null}, {"title": "Horatius Cocles defending the Bridge", "artist": "Oil", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-EdiVdRV9X2VJRLFhApyqHX2UTYqYMgjP6ps8kQT4x3PRsC8qqEliAONRt6ggwaHIT9u4r9L4", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Cannon Shot", "artist": "Willem van de Velde II", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM93suYDSkl73yAROkSIkJIu28CzIGJQXRwsz6dysSKu2T_6vnairjJgs7wCuRd3-NaYPuU9yhw", "desc": "This painting is the pendant of The gust, which depicts a ship in a raging storm.

Like Bruegel, Teniers creates episodes in which we can recognise the vices of Lechery (in the man molesting a woman to the right of centre), Wrath (two men are kept from each other in the background), drunkenness (in the figure sleeping it off to the lower right) and general boorishness (seen throughout). The mood is much more concerned, however, with characteristic behaviour (the two sealing a bargain to the left), careless folly and comical high spirits, especially in the principal couple dancing with such cheerful and inexpert abandon. The way in which the old man looks on to the left suggests the indulgent wisdom of the village elder. It is tempting to conclude that this happy scene is a celebration of the Treaty of Munster of 1648 (the year before the painting was executed), which had brought to an end eighty years of war. In the same year as this work (1649) David Ryckaert III clearly alluded to the recent conflict in a pair of paintings called Peasants Sorrow and Peasants Joy (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), the former a scene of soldiers plundering and the latter a Kermis like this one. Another version of Tenierss design (now lost) seems to have been painted for William II, Prince of Orange (1626-50), the stadtholder and Dutch commander-in-chief. A drawing recording the design (Hessisches Landesmuseum, Darmstadt) is inscribed with an instruction to execute a painting from it for His Highness my Lord the Prince of Orange. This is not the Prince of Oranges painting, as was once believed; apart from anything else it includes a coat of arms with the double eagle of the Habsburgs - hardly appropriate for a Dutch soldier. The existence of the other version raises the interesting possibility that two versions of this design were created at the time of the truce, one for each of the two sides involved in the war. If so, then the painting perfectly sums up the rural customs and the Bruegelian artistic heritage, which were equally valued by both sides, at the same time as providing an image of harmony and reconciliation. George IV was typical of his age in setting an especially high value of the works of David Teniers; this work was the most expensive Teniers in his collection, valued in his 1819 inventory at an astonishing 1500 guineas.

They werealso a suitable means for him to present himself to the public: a form of selfmarketing. The term \u201cself-portrait\u201d was not yet common in 17th-century Holland; such a painting was more likely to be referred to as \u201ca portrait of Rembrandt painted by himself\u201d. Thus for the ambitious collector, the painting was two things: Rembrandt\u2019s image and at the same time an example of his art. Rembrandt has concentrated the meagre light on his face. His simple garment, trimmed only at the shoulders and collar, is gently illuminated and only hints at his stature. Entirely fixated on the ageing facial features, the viewer is initially distracted from the self-confident, almost challenging posture. The two thumbs hooked into a belt that seems to have been cursorily tied at the waist are a self-confident antipode to the melancholy, complexly painted countenance. Rembrandt\u2019s face is further emphasised by its contrast to other parts of the portrait with their uniformly thick application of paint, in general a characteristic of his late works. In contrast to earlier self-portraits in which the artist is often dressed in sumptuous fabrics, Rembrandt has chosen a simple garment; perhaps it is even the artist\u2019s smock that he actually wore in his studio."}, {"title": "Nude Woman with a Snake", "artist": "Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_VoiRZMijebbVPtpednguTJRF8_mlpLzQsF6V4ioO2UcwFk397AYv_CRJtaQldkNKvT49GKA", "desc": "Who is this woman?

In fact, Rembrandt used this drawing as the basis for his depiction of Eve in his drawing and subsequent etching  Adam and Eve  of 1638.   Rembrandt applied red chalk energetically, describing the swell of  the womans belly with strong horizontal strokes. Vertical shading along her legs conveys her bodys taut strength. He also exploited the brilliance and luminosity of the red chalk by applying white gouache underneath it, particularly in the womans arm and torso.

The intellectual element, the mind, capable of regulating everything, is now contrasted even more strongly with the passions. A strict order now prevails in his works. His heroes show restraint in expressing their feelings, preferring to debate and evaluate what is taking place. The colors lose their indeterminate nature and the structure of his pictures is dictated by a clear design and local color repeated in various shades. From the ancients Poussin developed his theory of the Modes, the idea that expressive devices should correspond to the content of a work. Wisdom and nobility govern the actions of the victor of Carthage, the Roman general Scipio Africanus, who overcomes his emotions and returns his captive to her betrothed in \"The Continence of Scipio\" (1640).

The bust was to be a papal present to Henrietta Maria and Urban VIII had specially arranged its creation at a time when hopes were entertained in Rome that the King might lead England back into the Roman Catholic fold. The bust was executed in the summer of 1636 and presented to the King and Queen at Oatlands on 17 July 1637. It was enthusiastically received by them and their court and universally admired not only for the exquisiteness of the worke but the likenese and nere resemblance it had to the King countenaunce. Bernini was rewarded in 1638 with a diamond ring valued at \u00a3800. The bust was destroyed in the fire at Whitehall Palace in 1698. The heads in the painting are drawn and modelled with a care and restraint unusual in Van Dyck. The contrast between the blue Garter ribbon and the three different colours of the Kings costume, which include three differently patterned lace collars; in the richly worked sky all contribute to turning a utilitarian commission into a work of great beauty. Van Dyck had presumably been influenced by Lottos Portrait of a Man in Three Positions (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), which was in Charles Is collection at this time. The Kings portrait in turn probably influenced Philippe de Champaigne, who in 1642 painted a Triple Portrait of Cardinal Richelieu (National Gallery, London) to assist Bernini (or another sculptor) with a bust of the Cardinal"}, {"title": "Judgment of Paris", "artist": "Pierre Brebiette", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8xSn9pQBEz2upiuvWo6puUJiJdtXhVnifO_5C1QCCnWYXhJ5CFpBGq7zG49oGrmZ1uLPCdKw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Anne of Cleves, Wife of Henry VIII", "artist": "Wenceslaus Hollar", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-RdxDoaTRk5XfdLKruBCxV7FEVC6xmEOjuWmK_4QqJb4qg_TFzNhm3I4K7oCcXLuiNHx4jHg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christus en de cijnspenning", "artist": "Vorsterman, Lucas (I", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8GvOiCm73u47DTGQosUtRclJAhWP-jLx_fhv-G8TmwsWmsGktfI42QlbmlyeuWCuiVbtPO5WA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Agnes", "artist": " Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_B_Ls5CE2wY32hzj-okp5zoJ0tlFrar1sDAZ_CbvUsfI7-YhK1nVEQEVQkiwwlDCjeCShGLp0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portret van Anna van Kleef, koningin van Engeland", "artist": "Hollar, Wenceslaus", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8moAWDtupd5Ot90nldTUsJjTZ4kFudmGGQMBjfAKl4XbqHqVjsouZ7-GnhWON_o5OlQ4Z6iW0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portret van Pieter Pietersz.

Bewildered, Europa grasps the bulls horn, digs her fingers into his neck, and turns back to look at her companions on the waters edge. One young woman falls to the ground and raises her arms in alarm, dropping the flower garland intended for the bulls neck into her lap, while her friend clasps her hands in consternation and watches helplessly. The carriage driver above rises to his feet and stares at the departing princess in horror. In the background, a city shrouded in mist extends along the horizon, perhaps serving as an allusion to the ancient city of Tyre as well as to contemporary Amsterdam.The dark thicket of trees to the right contrasts with the pink and blue regions of the sea and sky. Sunlight breaks through the clouds and reflects off the water, but the sky behind the trees is dark and foreboding.

The result is an unreal and abstract compositional space.His characteristic painting style breaks away from the outlines and is flooded with light. Thus Fetti partly anticipated the achievements of the late-Baroque Venetian painters, e.g. Guardi. During a celebration in honour of Aphrodite, Leander became enamoured of Hero, who, however, had devoted her life to serving the goddess of love as a priestess. Thus they had to keep their love secret. Leander, who lived in Abydos on the other side of the Hellespont (today\u2019s Dardanelles), swam across the dangerous strait every night, guided by a light that Hero put in the window of her tower. When a storm extinguished the fire one night, the youth lost his bearings and drowned. Hero found his corpse washed ashore the following morning, and in despair she flung herself from her tower into the sea. The scene of Hero mourning her lover is moved into the foreground, while Fetti depicts the tragic fate of the heroine on the right. Domenico Fetti was court painter to Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga of Mantua, who had probably met the artist in Rome. In 1621 at the latest, the painter travelled to Venice for the second time. Upon his return he fell out with the Gonzaga, and Fetti moved back to Venice, never to return to Mantua. Along with two other works (KHM, GG, Inv. Nos. 172, 7722), the present painting was among the last by the artist, who died prematurely. It is possible that this series was commissioned by a Venetian client and conceived as decoration for a piece of furniture or wall panelling."}, {"title": "The Goldfinch", "artist": "Fabritius", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9LqEkVsUHQ2mA3nY3J-VDp2dS7TeytxLsOyv9Cak1LyPvDBeWMae8GnWEJ_bbxr6PvqdVW9F8", "desc": null}, {"title": "Titlepage to Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'", "artist": "Antonio Tempesta", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-iBf4QTTZNBxSlWhV4ZsdIio-7axiw50NI4aTJTFnxoV5V4ggmClfZ4JiVXjqTEkZRf_0BjA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Mar\u00eda Teresa (1638\u20131683), Infanta of Spain", "artist": "Diego Rodr\u00edguez de Silva y Vel\u00e1zquez", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8fQ8_CmcCsGpyg113aMzSrk9zwIzB5zzrj6rv47LMoRM4vMHrfcTOSGpVBuzmFLRXJWfLz36Zv", "desc": null}, {"title": "Franse hoveling die het Edict van 1633 navolgt", "artist": "Bosse, Abraham", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_jhyLxpNyzho7YYNoRzZqiRwZu00jtignhmaP8N0_tDtr6IEiIEFNr55xVqYOsJ2E_NB97w2M", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Road to Emmaus", "artist": "Claes Moeyaert", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM__7ABvmgvczlFSS2P-qf-OSfpl-mpRqJyY0ByV3ENsicZL4ZtxnQIHwwd9oKcBpGdM03709HY", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of Cardinal Federico Corner", "artist": "Bernardo Strozzi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8wAG8mNR-g2er3EB3RFjFg7QExNaTa783nTdwk3NY0-N8to8nlQrJUlUF23RlFmZbdd0ETVg", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Nile Flooding", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM964TbNvXbV_qOs19WkF84bP3phRDK7YBT_UJ6NgMkAXl7b9EdktWIAcKkvUlapJ6CYxm6SzQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Family Group in an Interior(Main View)", "artist": "Quiringh Gerritsz. van Brekelenkam", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-JVLoyq7DcVDsuRPsEKNXh3HqCkugC01XM9RkHKVFvwUxBPdNs0pI901_QS2S79CiRx7cdGEQ", "desc": "Just finishing a Sunday meal, the members of this well-to-do family may be getting ready to return to church.

The upper part of the slanting dune is covered with trees while the lower section is a field of grass occupied by grazing flocks of sheep and their shepherds. The sheep and figures are mere dots against the expansive landscape. The detailed depiction of light and shadow is particularly effective in the grass on the dunes and in the central trees and water, eloquently attesting to the artists careful examination of nature. This work is not, however, simply \"a fragment of nature.\" All of its elements are carefully calculated and placed, providing a depiction of an \"arranged\" nature.

The flower goddess Flora, under a flag adorned with tulips and holding three of the valuable blooms in her hand, is enthroned in her chariot, depicted here as a wagon of fools. Three men wearing fools\u2019 caps on their heads ride with her. Leckebardt (gluttony) cannot keep off the drink, Graegrijk (avarice) holds a bag of money and Liegwagen (loose talk), with a bell in his hand, tells his empty tales. Dame Vergaeral (collector\u2019s mania) weighs tulip bulbs in a set of scales (bulbs were sold by weight) and the bird of hope flies away from Dame IJdel Hoop (vain hope). The wagon of fools will shortly be lost at sea. The wagon is followed by a group of Haarlem weavers. They have abandoned their work, and walk behind the wagon. Haarlem weavers are known to have tried their luck in the speculation in tulips.

Drypoint lines are made by scratching directly into a metal plate with a sharply pointed tool, creating a furrow with fragile ridges of metal on either side of the line. This displaced metal, called \u201cburr,\u201d captures extra ink, producing diffuse tonal effects when printed. Burr wears down quickly from pressure in the printing press, diminishing these velvety accents with each printing.By the time Rembrandt created The Three Crosses, his most ambitious print, he had been exploring religious subjects in prints and paintings for more than two decades. He reworked the plate five times, but made the most dramatic changes in this, the fourth state. Abandoning the worn lines of his initial composition, the artist forcefully gouged the plate as he created new figures, allowing their raw, jagged outlines to overlap the faint remains of earlier ones. No longer firmly modeled, the people become apparitions, while the body of Christ alone has substance. Rembrandt further transformed the scene by deeply scratching long, vertical lines that cast all but Christ into shadow. One of the crucified men is plunged entirely in darkness, recalling the passage in the book of Luke when the resentful criminal derides Christ, who, in turn, promises salvation to the other thief. Through his reworking of the plate, Rembrandt seemingly drew upon a lifetime of biblical meditation to create this compelling interpretation of Christ\u2019s crucifixion"}, {"title": "Still Life with Pie and Silver Ewer", "artist": "Willem Claesz Heda", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_usBZtqth7LzBBXCe0LLo9unyHtm2wrKFl8uqJ7YjvvSk2PAV4e8HeOYA1SmmCfY95ItgoK-Fp", "desc": "From 1640 onwards, Heda\u2019s still lifes became ever more crowded.

The artistic challenge for the painter was no longer solely to render materials with deceptive realism, but also to place a great variety of objects in a harmonious composition. Heda went with the times, and also started to paint these  opulent still lifes. In this \u2013 still comparatively simple \u2013 piece, he reveals himself to be an accomplished master of the genre.Heda is sometimes described as the master of reflection. In this painting he has taken full advantage of the reflective qualities of shiny materials.

In this flower painting we can delight in his realistic depiction of tulip petals, long bent reeds of wheat, minute animals including butterflies, ants, snails, caterpillars, and finally, reflections on the transparent glass vase"}, {"title": "Musizierende Engel", "artist": "Peter Paul Rubens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_w2Qwn_GYG51nBpHsVghda_AGwL43BUvputm_zYlK7g6yQWW08BhaklFmChD4Hj2SXHwjyBB0", "desc": "Das Gem\u00e4lde von Rubens (1577-1640) bestand urspr\u00fcnglich aus zwei Skizzen, die als Entwurf f\u00fcr Kartons geschaffen wurden. Diese dienten ihrerseits als Vorlage einer Teppichserie. Bei den Gobelins handelte es sich um eine Serie des \"Triumph der Eucharistie\", die im Auftrag der Statthalterin der spanischen Niederlande, Erzherzogin Isabella Clara Eugenia (1566-1633), in Br\u00fcssel angefertigt und 1628 fertiggestellt wurde. Sie war f\u00fcr das Kloster \"Las Descalzas Reales\" in Madrid bestimmt. Die Skizzen wurden bald nach ihrer Entstehung zusammengef\u00fcgt und teilweise \u00fcbermalt, um eine einheitliche Darstellung zu gew\u00e4hrleisten. In der Mitte erkennt man noch heute die \u00fcbermalte Fuge. Zwischen den beiden einzelnen Darstellungen des Engelskonzerts befand sich bei der Teppichserie die Wiedergabe einer von Engeln pr\u00e4sentierten Monstranz, aus der g\u00f6ttliches Licht hervorgeht - das Thema der Serie unterst\u00fctzend, den \"Triumph der Eucharistie\".

Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work.[56] He took easily to etching and, though he also learned to use a burin and partly engraved many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing, but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.[57] He worked on the so-called Hundred Guilder Print in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.[58] Although the print only survives in two states, the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.Almost all Rembrandt etchings were printed in more than one state, above ten in some cases. They are generally small changes minimum adjustments or amendments, but there are cases where the changes are so drastic that result in a new composition.

Each image in the series is minutely worked to reveal the philosophy and character of its subject, an approach that would have appealed to the humanists of the day. However, Ribera distanced himself from the traditional iconographic framework for such images, and in spite of the fact that these works were meant to represent wise men, he painted from actual models and rejected all idealization as he created powerful depictions of their actual figures. If the inscription on the lower right of this painting is reliable, this canvas depicts the Theban philosopher Crates. This philospher, a Cynic active around 320 B. C., is known to have been the student of Diogenes and the teacher of Zeno, the founder of Stoicism. Crates abandoned his property to become a mendicant and the author of didactic parodies, tragedies and dramas. Crates is known to have been a kind, wise and fascinating character with an ugly face. However, the man shown here is not particularly ugly in Riberas philosopher series. This painting is known to have been in the collection of the Prince of Lichtenstein in the mid 18th century, and judging from historical documents, it is surmised to have been one of a series of six works painted for the Prince in 1636-37. Today this series is divided between museums in the west and the NMWA. All six works were gathered for display in 1992 when the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, held an exhibition on Ribera. That opportunity to view the six works together revealed that there are slight differences in the styles of the six works, and thus it is clear that some of the paintings involved work by Riberas studio. Of the six works, the NMWAs image of Crates was particularly noteworthy for its powerful, true touch.

His daughter Pero, however, who had just given birth to a child, gained entry to the prison and saved her elderly father by nursing him at her breast. This theme was especially popular in Baroque times because, on the one hand, it was an example of Christian charity (caritas christiana)\u2014next to faith and hope, one of the three Christian virtues. On the other hand, it presented an irresistible opportunity to depict an erotic image. Bellucci arranged his figures in the shape of a pyramid.

The portrait of Zaffius is thought to be the earliest known painting by Frans Hals, although the attribution has been disputed on stylistic grounds. Frans Hals has a recognizable style; he is known for his assured and spontaneous brushwork. This image of Jacobus Zaffius, although it is a good portrait, does not altogether reflect this style. In 1630 Jan van de Velde II made an engraving of the portrait of Zaffius. Below the print is the legend \u2018Frans Hals pinxit\u2019 (Frans Hals painted this). In the print Zaffius is shown from the waist up. His hand rests on a skull. Because the print shows more than the painting, it was thought that the painting was originally larger, but this is not the case.

Claude Lorrain\u2019s career is closely associated with Italy. He had learned perspective in Naples and figurative painting in Rome, where he also lived beginning in 1627, painting mainly for the local aristocracy. His pictures quickly earned renown throughout Europe, especially for his elevation of the sun as visible source of illumination to the status of principal subject in pictures flooded with warm light, and his free combination of coastal landscapes with Roman villas, ancient monuments, and mythological and pastoral scenes. The artist achieved this effect of diffuse light with a special technique: the exceptional nuance with which he graded his slowly drying oil paint created subtle, imperceptible transitions. He also applied the thinnest of glazes between the layers to produce his unmistakable glow. The Kunsthaus owns two works by Claude Lorrain; the Pastoral with the Arch of Constantine has an interesting provenance. It belonged originally to the English scholar and art collector Sir Horace Walpole, who showed it in the famed gallery in his country home of Houghton Hall in the first third of the 18th century.

Their doubts were mainly caused by the coarse style of painting; the scholars of the time found it difficult to reconcile this coarseness with what they thought of as the typically very meticulous and carefully finished style of Rembrandts early works. Recent art history has, however, pointed out that even during the earliest stage of his career - the years spent painting in his native town of Leiden - Rembrandt experimented with broader and more varied brushstrokes. Like other works by the young Rembrandt, this small painting appears to be a practice piece.

Although he never took in pupils, Caravaggio\u2019s enormous influence on other artists played a vital role in the development of the Italian Baroque. In this Saint John the Baptist, Caravaggio has traded idealism for what oftentimes became in his own time a controversial realism. He has literally stripped the Baptist of nearly all traditional attributes (halo, lamb and banderole inscribed Ecce Agnus Dei or Behold the Lamb of God), leaving the brooding intensity of his emotional state as the subject of the painting. Saint John\u2019s solemn pensiveness is reinforced by a Caravaggio trademark: the dramatic contrast of deep, opaque shadows, playing across the body and shrouding the sockets of the eyes, with a bright light that illuminates the Baptist from above and to his right. This stark contrast of light and darkness, the brilliant scarlet of the saint\u2019s cloak and Caravaggio\u2019s placement of him in the foreground close to our own space, all contribute to the dramatic impact of the painting. Evidence of Caravaggio\u2019s working method, in which he incised lines into the gesso ground to guide his hand while painting, can be easily seen along the sitter\u2019s left leg in the right corner.

An unruly child is depicted here: his mother or wet nurse is apparently carrying it out of a room. The child is screaming and kicking so much that his garment has ridden up above his waist and he has lost a shoe. An old woman gives him a few words of admonishment for his way, and two children interestedly observe the scene. At first glance, Rembrandt seems to have drawn the scene from life. At one time, it was even believed that Rembrandts wife Saskia and his children were to be seen in such depictions of family life. However, the schematic repetition of faces and gestures is particularly characteristic of the artist\u2019s images of children. Rembrandt recorded the same boy from this sheet multiple times, e.g. in the drawing in Dresden of Ganymede abducted by the eagle.

The essence of his magic was perhaps put most aptly by a contemporary writer, Francisco de Quevedo: Vel\u00e1zquez did not mimic reality, he created it. In this Tavern Scene and similar youthful bodegons (kitchen or tavern scenes named after the bodega, or inn) naturally the Spanish genius does not unfold in full maturity. Common folk populate the canvasses, in apparently banal situations, as if pages from the picaresque novels of Quevedo and his peers had come to life, where the larks of crafty servants and other villainous ruffians tickled the readers fancy. This startling naturalism often invited claims of Caravaggios influence, but at the time Vel\u00e1zquez had not even seen the pictures of the Italian vagabond. Even more importantly, in Velazquez there is no trace of Caravaggios violent coarseness, however vulgar the subject may be, and a kind of calm, puritanical solemnity vibrates in the air.

The fur trimming on the couple\u2019s clothes and the handkerchief are signs of prosperity and wealth. However, a key concern was to present Anslo in his function as a preacher. His mouth is slightly open, he is pointing to the open book with the left hand, and turning to his wife, who is inclining her head a little, as a sign that she is paying attention. The essential elements of this scene, the book, faces and hands, are emphasized by the handling of light, while the remainder is plunged into monumental chiaroscuro. This impressive representation of speaking and listening is vivid evidence of the Reformation\u2019s view that the word is superior to the image. A specific reference to the admonition specific to the Mennonites (based on Matthew 18, 15-20) is provided by the wick-trimmer that can be seen behind the candle. According to Picinello this symbolizes the \u201ccorrectio fraterna\u201d, the brotherly admonition \u201cthat frees the soul from the clinging slime of confusion as the wick-trimmer the candles from the dripping wax\u201d.

They were inspired in this desire by a celebrated model, one, however, that they could never hope to match: the collection begun in the early 17th century by the Spanish regent in Brussels. Parallel to this, and only in the southern Netherlands, a type of painting developed in which picture galleries were shown. During his regency (1647\u20131656), the most important Habsburg collector, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, assembled some 1400 paintings. This view of his gallery is likely fictitious in part because the high room with windows on the left is probably not exactly like any space that existed at the time. The size and proportions of some of the decoratively hung pictures have been altered, in reality, they could never have been hung in that combination. Here David Teniers, chamberlain, court painter and keeper of the archduke\u2019s art collection, is accompanying the scholarly collector on a visit to his gallery. On the left, other visitors are grouped around a table, among them the diminutive castle chaplain, painter and later gallery director Antonius van der Baren. Among the elements often found in views of picture galleries are the paintings propped up in the foreground and the opening of the perspective to the rear, sometimes through a door or, as here, through large windows. Early examples of this type sometimes feature Christian didactic content, conveyed by a selection of pictures depicted in miniature; the portraits of Leopold Wilhelm\u2019s gallery (nine in all), however, serve a purely ostentatious purpose. The one now in Vienna was sent to Prague by the brother of its owner, Emperor Ferdinand III, as evidence of the wealth of the archduke\u2019s picturegallery.

This predilection for Lipsio, that responds, without doubt to a canon of overall renewal of the city\u2019s aristocracy, assumed an important role also in the art world, to which the presence of Peter Paul Rubens contributed, who boasted a direct frequentation of the philosopher, mentor of his brother Philippe, also evidenced by group portrait Lesson of the Philosopher Giusto Lipsio in Antwerp (1611 circa) conserved in the Gallery of Palazzo Pitti in Florence. Within this cultural ferment one finds the work by Gioacchino Assereto, that since his youth had grappled with subjects drawn from philosophy and ancient history, including The Infant Servius Tullius with his Hair in Flames (Art Collection of Banca Carige), Phocion Refuses Alexander\u2019s Gifts (Nantes, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts) and The Death of Cato (Genova, Palazzo Bianco). An interest that probably enjoyed renewed momentum following the journey of the painter to Rome in 1639 when, conceivably, he was able to come into contact with the Marquis Vincenzo Giustinani, great collector of Caravaggio and passionate connoisseur of the ancient world, who at the time was preparing the \u201cRoom of the Philosophers\u201d with a series of paintings admittedly inspired by the neostoic precepts, such as The Death of Seneca by Joachim von Sandrart, The Death of Socrates by the mysterious \u201cFlemish Giusto\u201d and The Death of Cicero by Fran\u00e7ois Perrier. Devoid of any narrative element, the painting is built on an intense dialogue, of extraordinary expressive power, of gestures and glances between the philosopher and his tormentor that intersect in opposed diagonals to show the different temperament of the characters and their opposite moral stature; both figures belong to an authentic humanity that corresponds to the complete acceptance of the artist of naturalistic tendencies, certainly matured on the models of international scope, the contact with which was facilitated by the role of Genoa, at the time economic and cultural crossroads of Europe. In the essay that appeared in \u201cDedalo\u201d in 1926, from which the critical recovery of the painter had its beginning, Roberto Longhi was the first to institute a stringent stylistic comparison between Diego Vel\u00e1squez and the \u201cGreat Assereto\".  Within this artistic culture is also inscribed in the open book on the knees of the philosopher, an intense example of still life and, at the same time, a reflection on the emptiness of human knowledge, certainly attributable to the maturity of the painter.

The subject had been treated by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, in his Peasant Dance of c.1568 as a Vanity Fair of drink-fuelled folly and vice. Jan Brueghel by contrast sees the Kermis as an emblem of the happiness of a well-ordered society at play. He adopts his fathers technique, of the universal panorama of life, with as many legible mini-incidents as space and ingenuity permit. This small copper is an inexhaustible record of life, which its original owner must have spent many hours reading. In the background bystanders kneel before the religious procession approaching the church. The pub in the left background is full; amongst many groups we can just make out a ring of peasants playing dice on a tree-stump table. In the middle ground two groups of peasants dance in a ring to the sound of bagpipes and hurdy-gurdy; a pair of children are trying to learn the same moves. One elderly woman in the near group has a ring of keys held on a cord, which flies out from her waist as she spins. Behind the nearer ring to the right there is a toy-seller (who has recently sold a hobbyhorse), a beggar or peddler in red talking to a man and his wife who appear to be in biblical fancy dress. The festivities are enjoyed by two groups of prosperous middle-class observers: one group of gallant young lovers (in the middle ground) have courtly manners which contrast with the peasant couple billing in the cart; the nearer group seems to include three generations of a single family, with their nursemaid. A jester is chased away (or possibly restrained with demands for an encore) by a group of children. Some beggars arrive at the extreme left foreground; children play with a ball across the centre; and an elderly couple share a ride home to the right, taking their flag and a basket full of produce. It is difficult not to see this as a celebration of the abatement of the war and an expression of hope for a lasting peace. This is an early example of a type of image, which defined the hopes and ideals of the rule of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella. Later examples of this subject, also by Jan Brueghel (Prado, dated 1623), depict the Archdukes themselves watching the festivities, as the city-dwellers do here. The distance here has exactly the same combination of Low Country foreground and Alpine distance seen in Pieter Bruegel the Elders work. Jan Brueghel here loses the mountains in the clouds with an indistinctness especially admired by the English theorist Edward Norgate, who advises artists to expresse your remonte Mountaines and grounds with a certaine airie Morbidezza or softnes, which is another remarkable grace and ornament of your worke"}, {"title": "The Artist's Mother: Head and Bust, Three-Quarters Right", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-LDqQSgwLLKE7O0_6pHeFAgYgiDwhDIH923rg-9JPNHTAYSo1akM6wEKMXQmcE5grhld-QPkQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Mooy-Aal en haar aanbidders", "artist": "Moeyaert, Nicolaes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8MZ8_PJWjw1FcjOfD1QP9sbHQCTqqEVPOGb6rQmD8NhW6hNNYRzDpGhQsEHEIVD6TZBPeSXQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Views of London:  The Piazza in Covent Garden", "artist": "Wenceslaus Hollar", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9tLLT1HhjymWmc6XO2H1z8pPcNZSXV8E5MTJtySt-zTDwHdLLz-ZgYxidhRWKB31odoTbYhRc", "desc": null}, {"title": "The miracles of St. Francis Xavier", "artist": "Peter Paul Rubens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-Ko-gQUnjBMDWiPkhXVzl5j3HFqnGCyq2Vuail1SbE4jCgaNHLawPW527dGkhFb-GBI_E_N4I", "desc": "Like a monument, the protagonist stands in a dark robe with deep folds on the plinth-like projection of a wall. Francis Xavier dominates the scene as the \u201cmissionary to the Asian peoples\u201d, his left hand pointing to Fides, the personification of faith, his right hand extended towards the toppling idols, and his gaze turned to the listeners and supplicants. Rubens has used dramatic lighting \u2013 the Jesuit is back-lit \u2013 to stage the group of listeners and observers, who, keeping a respectful distance, are bathed in bright light. Standing in the shadows the armoured soldier creates an optical turningpoint in the composition, leading the gaze of the viewer to the actual miracle depicted: in the left foreground deathly pale figures are rising from their graves. The blind man on the right, whose striking posture is based on a work by Raphael, provides counterbalance in the composition. His outstretched arms also strengthen the compositional effect of the \u201cplinth\u201d on which Francis Xavier is standing.It was hoped that placing the work on the high altar of the new church in 1618 would hasten the canonisation of Francis Xavier, and indeed both he and the founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius of Loyola, were canonised in 1622. In additionto the modello (KHM, GG 528), the altarpiece was preceded by a large number of drawings of the individual elements. Most of the execution of the monumental altarpiece, which was designed to be viewed from a distance and create maximum effect in the church, was carried out by members of Rubens\u2019s studio with the great painter himself only reworking important features.

Here the wooded scene is used as the setting for the tale of Abraham and Isaac, as they headed towards Moriah. There Abraham, seen on a donkey, intended to sacrifice his only son according to Gods will. In the instant before Abraham was going to kill Isaac, an angel appeared and ordered Abraham to stop. In this painting, Isaac is shown gathering firewood for his own sacrificial pyre. Two of the surrounding five figures are woodcutters. The wooded area is divided into sections by the differences in the clarity of the light seen in each area. The scene is made up of three sections, the foreground woods which are dark, the brightly lit middle ground around the small stream, and the distance glimpsed between the trees. The wooded scene is shown in intricate and accurately realistic detail, forming a contrast with the hazily rendered, non-realistic depiction of the far distance. Such depiction is more reminiscent of realistic 17th-century Dutch landscapes than the traditional world view landscapes of Flemish painting. \tThe inclusion of ancillary figures in an expansive landscape to transform an ordinary landscape painting into a painting with a Biblical theme was a characteristic form of Flemish landscape painting. However, the characteristic form was not simply a stage setting for the narrative, it too was imbued with symbolic meaning. The subject of Abraham and Isaac, from the medieval period onwards, was seen as a typology of the Crucifixion, and it is possible that here the landscape scene has some symbolic meaning related to the subject. However, on the other hand, the wooded scene shown here was used again by Jan in his The Rest on the Flight into Egypt (1607, The State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg). In spite of the fact that the woods, cut off from everyday life, might somehow represent a sacred space, it seems that Jan made very little connection between the landscape motifs and each individual Biblical scene he placed in them. This painting is a superb example of the wooded scenery that became an important painting genre in Netherlandish painting from the 16th century through the 17th century.

This small work is an oil sketch for one of these works, St. Justa and St. Rufina now in the Seville Museum. Except for several discrepancies in the pottery at the feet of the saints, this painting presents almost exactly the same composition as that of the completed work. The work depicts the two patron saints of Seville, holding the hemp leaves symbolic of their martyrdom in their hands, and supporting a miniature of the citys symbol, the Giralda Tower. The completed work is from the artists most accomplished period in the 1660s, showing his mature figural style amidst a light-filled sky. While this work is simply a study and hence we cannot expect to find Murillos typical elements here, instead it provides us with a direct reflection of the artists ideas and aesthetic sentiments. A sketch of almost exactly the same composition is now in the collection of the Bonnat Museum in Bayonne in southern France.\tSt. Justa and St. Rufina were sisters and Christians famous for their pottery who lived in Seville during the Roman Empire. When they refused the order for pagan ritual implements from a Roman priest, they were martyred in Seville sometime around the year 286. Pottery became the symbol for the two saints, and the Giralda Tower is frequently shown in works depicting the two sisters. This inclusion of the tower is based on the tradition that the sisters descended from heaven in 1504 and embraced the tower to protect it from a great earthquake.

The handling of the figures, however, shows the influence of Italian Mannerist sculpture of the 1600s. The sculptor, Giovanni Francesco Susini, welded the three nude figures together in an intensely dramatic composition. While Paris attempts to carry Helen off, she valiantly struggles against him. Below them a female servant protests. The women twist around the central spiral of Pariss lithe body. Susini arranges the figures as if on a stage; both Paris and Helen turn their faces toward the front. Yet, the spiral composition also encourages the viewer to walk around the piece, offering interesting alternate perspectives.

Over the course of his 40-year career he painted, drew and etched roughly 80 self-portraits. They trace his life and career from ambitious young artist, through the confident and successful painter of the 1630s and 1640s to the aged, troubled master of his late years. This painting at Kenwood was one of his last. It was begun around 1665 when Rembrandt was 59. Among the largest and most imposing of all Rembrandt\u2019s self-portraits, it is celebrated for its technical brilliance and ruthless honesty, offering one of the most distinctive and defining images of the artist.Unlike many of his earlier self-portraits, in which Rembrandt depicted himself artificially posed or acting out a part in an elaborate costume, Self-Portrait with Two Circles shows him simply as a painter in his studio. He is plainly dressed in working clothes with a fur-lined tabard, traditionally worn by painters since the 16th century, along with a simple white linen cap. In his left hand he holds the tools of his trade \u2013 a wooden palette, brushes, and a long mahlstick, a tool used as a rest to steady his hand while painting. To the right can be seen the edge of the canvas on which he is working. Rather than showing himself in the act of painting, Rembrandt stares directly at us, with one hand on his hip.An X-ray of Self-Portrait with Two Circles reveals that Rembrandt dramatically altered the composition of the painting and in doing so, changed the way in which he presented himself. Originally, Rembrandt had painted himself at work. The x-ray shows him turned further to his left, with his left hand raised in the act of painting. His artist\u2019s tools \u2013 palette, brushes and mahlstick \u2013 are held in his right hand. We know from other self-portraits that Rembrandt did not paint with his left hand. The error presumably happened because Rembrandt was precisely copying his reversed reflection in a mirror. He therefore altered the composition, transferring his tools into his left hand, realigning his body with the front of the picture plane, and hiding his now empty right hand in the folds of his painter\u2019s tabard. In doing so, Rembrandt transformed the painting from an image of an artist at work, captured in the act of creating a painting, to the image of an artist in his studio. The focus is no longer on the action of painting but on Rembrandt\u2019s likeness.There is an on-going debate about whether Rembrandt ever finished Self-Portrait with Two Circles.Some areas of the painting, like the white linen cap and his right hand resting on his hip, appear to have been merely \u2018blocked in\u2019, ready for the artist to return to later. Other areas of the canvas, The painting is neither signed nor dated, which is unusual for Rembrandt\u2019s self-portraits. Some scholars have argued that he no longer felt the need to sign his work, as he was a celebrity in his lifetime, known as nostrae aetatis miraculum (the wonder of our age) and his face would have been recognisable to many. Some art historians have even gone so far as to suggest that by the 1660s, Rembrandt may have felt that his distinctive style of painting was a signature itself.The two enigmatic circles in the background, from which the painting takes its name, have fascinated and perplexed viewers and scholars for generations. There are many theories surrounding the meaning of the circles. The most popular theory focuses on a story about the great Italian painter Giotto (d.1337), who reputedly proved his artistic skill by drawing a perfect circle freehand. Although Rembrandt paints two incomplete circles rather than one perfect circle, scholars have suggested that he is associating himself with Giotto\u2019s legendary genius, using his own distinctive, virtuoso style.Overlooking London\u2019s Hampstead Heath since the early 17th century, Kenwood House was transformed in the 18th century into a grand neoclassical villa.

The precious cargo was first brought to Antwerp, where the present portrait was probably painted. According to contemporary sources, Lanier spent seven days in van Dyck\u2019s studio, sitting for the Flemish painter, who had returned from Italy only a short time earlier (1627). They possibly knew one another from van Dyck\u2019s first short stay in England (1620/21). Lanier, his right arm self-confidently placed a kimbo, is clad in silken courtly attire. Covering his left shoulder and upper body, the black fabric of his cloak creates an impressive contrast to the red and white colour of his shirt; his right hand is hidden beneath it, while his left rests on the hilt of his sword. The narrow vista of an idyllic landscape extends the image towards the back. Lanier\u2019s posture and expression are in keeping with sprezzatura, the \u201celegant nonchalance\u201d typical of the ideal courtier, described by Baldassare Castiglione in his Book of the Courtier (Il Libro del Cortegiano, 1528) and especially cultivated at the Stuart court. In addition, van Dyck adopted a classical compositional type from Titian. He probably did so in the knowledge that Lanier would give the picture to the English king, who with the ducal collection of Mantua had just acquired one of the finest collections of Venetian paintings. Van Dyck\u2019s tribute to Titian probably resulted in his being summoned again to the English court in 1632, where he would create a new type of English noble portrait that has retained its effectiveness to this day."}, {"title": "Sermon on the Mount", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_dpsUM9MbuxM6afTOGiD5PuDhe-t29BnAo6b4d-GQnVMscigv1E6anFypiNbSYF5KZzNxowXk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ephraim Bonus", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8ni9Q4AImkEaHbGTr5HbDYE_B7EDcTvhtiy7ZP6s_ueOGm9SI3ogcY4I5HDcpEfU8g2Izt3w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Skirmish in a Roman Circus", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9DCa1HaexAYblOindnqHF4yT-7rhtl8_rs5Yp0xtfbSxk4RTEQCi5h8wSeAUSjEE1DPuWC2w", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Artist's Mother, Head and Bust", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_4gQhAHbJ3i4atS0pQdP0NPpeucFBuBcYtN8XTk9Id7tANup59rutD2bIpDhlsn_Gy9eGBqg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Selene en Endymion", "artist": "Lairesse, Gerard de", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Yz0wzU36NCAsoKK6x9Z5vaRslVKpft0rWyLc5Voln_GqjxKsG4gZ82mK6qPVhaIECxj7Sy3U", "desc": "De kuise maangodin Selene (of Diana) houdt van de herder Endymion.

Jacob van Ruisdael, one of the great Dutch landscape painters of the 1600s, explored a range of landscape motifs in his work, including forest scenes, seascapes, beach scenes, and panoramic landscapes. In Bridge with a Sluice, Ruisdael made an ordinary object monumental by making it larger than all the other elements in the painting, thereby calling attention to its use and placement in the countryside. The diagonal movement of the rugged road at the left draws the eye up toward the sluice and then down to the land below. A single figure populates the scene, but the sluice symbolizes the human presence in nature and human attempts to control it"}, {"title": "Heilige Hieronymus en de trompet", "artist": "Ribera, Jusepe", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9QctcKtfvLeybiYqmvSDDWjNtGbVJvenP5HNeylLHyYszGImd05x5CPtfh6Zk6cO29Xx7T-Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Angel Appearing to the Shepherds", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-SwsrQPojDMJFY6nvDJnhrjCNTGSZrSc5ASf06zDPcFMfNgDnPCFccCACeqB7aaOGDsw-omC8", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Young Innkeeper", "artist": " For more information about this and thousands of other works of art in the NGA collection, please visit\u00a0http://www.nga.gov/", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8XzL2UeFU5_scX8JO1-TroMKrarj_Gu_c6ZEZCxsyHWQpR7SL_bwhlNG8gHPK--qhraYwKdA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of a Man", "artist": "Frans Hals", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8folTez2k63zzFxct_ZdCmZGziBthqdQQOIUPbh99OqG_VAZPreQxuPeYj42k9qCay6RMQLw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Paul of Thebes tempted by a demon, after Magnasco", "artist": "Alessandro Magnasco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9W4fU3qzyMrNgmDTS23swPMmrE6ZU3wF0O0dPpKt_OQXCzD44a-QXGamvI-ZxWEXkOzxCwoUY", "desc": null}, {"title": "Studies of Figures", "artist": "Drawing", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9GPMi_FrTK2kL7_luYth90zOCyivFVvEnRZYZC0RQ440Uik03t2KiOI66MQM-HiZWIKV1Ung", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Condemnation to Death", "artist": " For more information about this and thousands of other works of art in the NGA collection, please visit\u00a0http://www.nga.gov/", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_MwoZvWM2vXZQxnSVQWL0_NY97nOS0QEQbKACulf_bKbFVsT7KXnD9JnSMP78JdT9Ihco6WQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portret van Willem I (1533-84), prins van Oranje, genaamd Willem de Zwijger", "artist": "Mierevelt, Michiel Jansz. van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9ky8UWgx3KXfkeslmf0qqfF7whSTLLwXi8OBDQD06eu6huSnJ3_lNOq6Ywp4ozOtcPY93bUg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Renard Makes Fun of the Bear from Hendrick van Alcmar's Renard The Fox", "artist": "Allart van Everdingen", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8QR6BsXPYYGXaY_npruUsDf7U6sFT_QEgVU2p2r8KwGsXIUXumt6cu83lskLoz-t43NrJeDA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Paul Shipwrecked on Malta", "artist": "Laurent de La Hyre", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-vLclFWMe44-6V7z_wEa1vyxdeGaWgAW53hoY7AfMtuBRbzqfkfOYeLS_MXHYy5Zd-nS6nIqU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Charles I (1600-49) with M. de St Antoine", "artist": "Sir Anthony Van Dyck", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_k7DSHFpzhiGqsmeqAOFi78Q1wFf9GMBvw_fjVN6tzaARo8rp8jV2yipQOuiyOPE9VBWYpUwM", "desc": "On his appointment as Principal Painter to Charles I in 1632, the Flemish artist Van Dyck - Rubenss most gifted follower - was required to specialise in portraiture. This is one of the chief paintings to result from his appointment, which revolutionised British painting and provided us with the enduring image of the Stuart court. With great fluency Van Dyck here portrays Charles I on horseback on an unprecedented scale, as ruler, warrior and knight, in the long tradition of antique and Renaissance equestrian monuments. The prominent display of the crowned royal arms and the triumphal arch framing the armed King reinforce his image as ruler of Great Britain, while the Kings refined features, loose hair and the sash of the Order of the Garter worn over his armour convey the impression of a chivalrous knight. Van Dyck may have designed the painting for its first position at the end of the Gallery at St Jamess Palace, where its theatrical effect impressed visitors. Both artist and patron admired and collected works by Titian, but a more direct influence was Rubenss 1603 portrait of the Duke of Lerma (Madrid, Prado) which Charles I would have seen on his visit to Spain as Prince of Wales in 1623. Skilled horsemanship was regarded as the epitome of virtu and here Pierre Antoine Bourdin, Seigneur de St Antoine, a master in the art of horsemanship, carries the Kings helmet. Sent by Henry IV of France to James I with a present of six horses for Henry, Prince of Wales, in 1603, he remained in the service of the Prince and later of Charles I, as riding master and equerry. He looks up at the King, whose poise stabilises a scene filled with baroque movement. Van Dyck went on to paint two other major portraits of the King with a horse: Charles I on Horseback, c.1636-8 (National Gallery, London) and Le Roi \u00e0 la Chasse, c.1635 (Louvre, Paris). The present painting hung at Windsor Castle for much of the nineteenth century; it is recorded in the Queens Presence Chamber and the Queens Ballroom (also known as the Van Dyck Room)"}, {"title": "Portretten van drie regentessen van het leprozenhuis in Amsterdam", "artist": "Bol, Ferdinand", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_5HOwORsZL50id1xIxVu-ZFQQJ6ihjGezryagMpO2tulGXNu95Ri_xZArVcFcS8YhLOeMBYw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Old Man with a Flowing Beard: Bust", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9g1Y7X5i3CbE8Kv3HKbS1Dhy-abs7G_fxt6C1XjpU5VtocOTlRjiTuRJA5CitibLLk_J_Z3Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "Heilige Hieronymus en de trompet", "artist": "Ribera, Jusepe", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-YkFwZDlhUeK3wFd6WEd9z44Psk2d-g421wUVh0AZScfbja3KuDAsTNZTd_KzdgIDVAJqr_Bo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Bataafse en Romeinse vloten op de Rijn, 69-70", "artist": "Tempesta, Antonio", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Wn5EOVo1el2CfoLrBKB6E0AERCBzq-OEG0nIY6y5NwVHZY8g3aXOTzj6knSJIIiC-HsEX", "desc": null}, {"title": "Allegory on the Power of Love ('Omnia Vincit Amor')", "artist": "Oil on canvas", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9-T5wDNcMcSRZn61uWUz3WYtEyGD1bgPpayJp4Rw7AJ8R3sItuuxDIaPumfh1xBXQmUEpMnvk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Large Grotesque Head", "artist": "Jusepe de Ribera", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-t3WRhjpqHUdX4OdR5QIJC9nPYz4SAhEJncdItAQ1bxeX81PliMIOFIrN38QcB8abPlOuo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Part of the Crowd at the Ecce Homo", "artist": "Sir Peter Paul Rubens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-p1UkD8kU6a6FTodlC1gSXVrt4cnRe7gWte9zmaAok5l8Uz2oi6PuvscaUjGhrFGY9fXrcmlSw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Cook", "artist": "Bernardo Strozzi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-OKnQg_dxJN9285GxQoCiLJOTfT_JhUYBZfsogCVGXPQnFRuQSNQIkwqdyRsJIMtp_zQFPUQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Gerome", "artist": "Guido Reni", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9EUvupvSUpS0lNzusXKa7oveQmI3jMLY31ZmyV4fUM6X5QWbYg4nxZ0luCSbnBxcojs8yEcg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Countess Ebba Sparre", "artist": "S\u00e9bastien Bourdon", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8T0k37GnnBqyvf0cYy42JxFBm7wPqxSwNcfQehcEx47nJCo65Z-6M_njvwDGs3blBMCDyvL38_", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christus aan het volk getoond: liggende plaat", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-Xron53OKlEyWU5JGKU-G08Pj_GtfMo5t3R1i2eiCrUiKq_8a63qkKgPQk4_G40XUWUpK6mw", "desc": null}, {"title": "St. Jerome Reading in the Wilderness", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9tqqRn_u4zjJOefWLe12JD0rD-UlNC7Absa4cQnWst5FuSKUILhd83xrOcaaCztV63I7mRcg0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Pyramids of Jugglers", "artist": "Stefano Della Bella", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-rhQWmLXoMFFhvO8l0GqapIFDP2dCHn4MRgmNGwOuH3YnJ0oJ77TGTBL8s2qyL8qlj-1yGHAg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christ on the Cross", "artist": "Peter Paul Rubens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9EaTpnz_U8VBXJCZy_uodN2Mr18OUIYSYKdkuFNBgHVH3fK-q8je3B6XvE1DrcDukfRpoFZ55d", "desc": "Rubens prepared this oil sketch in 1628 to serve as a design for an altarpiece commissioned by the Church of St. Michael, Ghent.

This canvas depicts the ascension to the throne of Louis XIII, seven years after the death of his father.More than a marine painting, this work represents a symbolic vision: the nave represents the kingdom, and the king, who is now of age, assumes control. Beside him, the queen shows him the way. The woman in front of the mast is an allegory of France;  she holds the symbols of sovereignty and authority. The four rowing figures are also symbolic, as they represent the royal virtues (Strength, Religion, Justice, and Harmony).

Like this we can find in first place, the description of a big flock of evil animals that surround him to set him on, bite him, sink their horns, tear his skin with their claws and hit him with stakes, just as described in the saints life. He is totally absorbed in his reading and meditations, under a crude wooden cabin, and he sees himself surrounded by a great number of evil monsters where we can see the most horrendous symbiosis of mammals, birds, reptiles and fish, with threatening attitudes or making horrific sounds and howls. All these evil satanic figures are symbols of the Deadly Sins and thus, represent sloth, gluttony, wrath, greed, pride, envy and especially, lust. Likewise, these revolting evil beings are symbols of the sicknesses the saint healed, mainly the plague and syphilis, as I said before. At the same time as the attacks from the diabolic monstrosities take place, the scene also represents the moment in which Saint Anthony suffers from carnal temptations, embodied by a flock of diabolic beings disguised as women. This is how, behind the saint, appears an elegant lady that leads a beautiful woman in front of the saint; the latter, dressed with the most luxurious fabrics and adorned with magnificent jewels like a princess or a queen, a figure that also refers to the vanity of mundane things that the saint despises. Behind them appears a completely naked woman that the sinister beings want to put in front of Saint Anthony so his chastity will be in danger, which they will fruitlessly try because the saint turns his back to them, taking refuge in his prayers. Lastly, in the upper right side, over a landscape of houses from a village, we can see how Saint Anthony, who is ascending to heaven, is surrounded by a legion of demons that try to make him fail in reaching his destiny"}, {"title": "Zelfportret met hoed met slappe rand en geborduurde mantel", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8icqbCEH28wuLFBJAY9sRPymkZz-s-OV7Vere3xHnnnurwsDjWQxv0TnxZua5W0ZvIeHjV_A", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landscape", "artist": "Cornelis van Poelenburch", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-_4KFyQ3J05TKJItFQ1jmCE_BeG-jr3nyzvSDz_fUm_5HaG-9ojYrQrmMXCIauirfvApWUZjA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Lot and His Family recalled home by Abraham", "artist": "Antonio Tempesta", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_glQCbMyAqKjoFMU2Z799PxjgY6_R9zbQlY99BGkYdqc7O-mWMMn7HgSrbKMfJ_ab56dIkWvBl", "desc": null}, {"title": "Crowning of Saint Catherine", "artist": "Peter Paul Rubens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-7LGTzqpRL-cWLScf64oRsUE5easx-ZWXIsWW4sIqCq3598-RBfc5oZW7NhZpUOt67IC3-jpQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Three Lion Heads", "artist": "Stefano Della Bella", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9PH6u1h3a1JmC19jg-u60I9hOxe-hRDaA5n3XWV8X3JlkJ-7OzDZCV6a9VMSlgxYe4YaxFL3Fh", "desc": null}, {"title": "Jesus with the Pharisees", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8v4-gQdQ7HuAyyktpEwy1fWAW2sDtsJvAiWGdKyurgdp8p_Vhu9epHiYCJZYU7QcxOc9LJ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hieronymus lezend", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-joCTh01ZbfFaoJaZTtwibIfmOnxuFqNQpSt4dFHniZTSLZWJKiN0DpHnGP5Qr6hsu21Z8Jw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of a Man", "artist": "Frans Hals", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-fyD8KinxGBHaa5OFBzzs6MoLV5y_2Lt6A5o4rLPFSkjDsavzvCzGyWqtlMZcWbFk1BrWgIx3m", "desc": "Portrait of a Man by Hals is striking for its compositional simplicity and tonal unity - both aspects indicative of the artists stylistic progression during the 1630s. The figure seems to burst out of the lower edge of the canvas. The sense of a strong physical presence is due to the spiral effect created by the jutting elbow on the viewers left and the hand holding a pair of gloves that extends from the tautened cloth on the right. Gloves held in the hand, as opposed to being worn, are regarded as a gesture of friendship, which in this case is being offered to the viewer. It is evident that Hals painted very fast, impulsively and fluently, varying the texture of the raised paint surface so that the treatment of the clothes and fabric is in marked contrast with the rather thinly painted facial features. Colour accents are at this stage reduced in value. Hals succeeds in making the impermanent seem permanent and the mobile to be immobile. This illusion is the equivalent of a freeze frame in cinematic technique. Given such visual pyrotechnics and such technical dexterity that increased with the years, it is no wonder that Hals was so admired in France during the nineteenth century by artists such as Edouard Manet and Vincent van Gogh.

Thus, de Hooch contrasts the seated figure seen in shadow with the standing figure who is walking from the sunlight into shadow. On the vertical axis there is a similar shift from the bright blue sky overhead to the darker tones in the lower half.The viewer is invited to enter what is essentially a private world. Both women are preoccupied by their simple domestic tasks. Even so, this private space partakes of a more public context. On the right beyond the house can be seen two towers: the taller one that of the Nieuwe Kerk, where William the Silent, the founder of the Dutch Republic, is buried, and the smaller one that of the Stadthuis. Another important feature of A courtyard in Delft is the close observation of the buildings, both as regards the materials from which they are constructed and the tonal relationships (especially the reds) of their silhouetted forms. Most convincing is the patchy distribution of the whitewash on the brick and the different types of mortar and pointing seen in a varying light. The gabled house flanking the tower of the Nieuwe Kerk can be made out in other courtyard paintings by de Hooch, adding to the sense that the artist devised his compositions within a tightly knit area that he knew intimately.

It appears newly picked; the petals and the leaves are still fresh, but it will not be long before the flower withers. The Roman poet Ovid called the anemone a \u2018windflower\u2019, because it clings to life for such a short time. In this still life, with its message of time slipping by, the flower certainly refers to the fugitive nature of life. Pieter Claesz is known chiefly for his monochrome still lifes. In this little panel, which dates from 1625, there are still many colourful elements like the red and white of the anemone and the blue of the silk ribbon attached to the pocket watch.

Van der Meer (c. 1574-1637) was a brewer, sheriff, burgomaster on more than one occasion and an officer of the civic guard. In his post of captain he was also painted by Frans Hals in the civic guard portrait of 1616. The couple were portrayed in two separate paintings, which belong together. The wall in one portrait appears to continue through into the other. Traditionally the portrait of the man hangs on the left and that of the woman on the right. In the course of his long career Frans Hals painted many of these pendant portraits of men and women.There is something strange going on with these two portraits. X-radiographs have revealed that the faces of Nicolaes and Cornelia have been painted over the top of other portraits. We do not know why this was done. Perhaps the sitters were not satisfied or became dissatisfied with their portraits; perhaps later owners (the portraits remained in the family for a long time) had the portraits altered. The coats of arms in the two paintings are also later additions, probably nineteenth century. The Prussian blue pigment used in the coats of arms was not in general use until after 1720, and the arms are not in evidence on a drawing after the portrait of Cornelia Vooght made by Johan van der Sprang in 1762"}, {"title": "The Washerwoman (A Woman Washing Clothes in a Tub)", "artist": "Gabriel Metsu", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8KE990QgwsOb4TFKK3tJbvOHxnb3iw39GUb9JwQ5l9zz0sbuOiAdAgbdWCJOCVde90BNJMgg", "desc": "This is one of several paintings in the possession of Stanis\u0142aw August which came from the Johan Aegidiusz van der Marck (1707\u201372) collection.

It is one of several small genre scenes with single figures of young women (mainly maids) engaged in their daily work, in a\u00a0domestic setting, which Metsu painted in the years 1656\u201357. Two of them\u2014the \u0141azienki Washerwoman and A Woman Scouring a\u00a0Pan (location unknown) are depicted against the stone arch of a\u00a0window niche.

From the 1620s to 1630s, he actively created a number of genre paintings, many of which featured a single person. As represented by The Merry Drinker (c. 1628-1630; Rijksmuseum Amsterdam), he introduced new elements which had not been seen in conventional portraits, such as casual, relaxed poses or friendly expressions and gestures that make it seem as if they are about to speak friendly to viewers from within the frame. Around the end of the 1630s, he strengthened his reflective tastes, changing colors to subdued conservative colors. This portrait, painted at the peak of Hals, accurately captures the dignified appearance of a preacher, and also shows spontaneous brushworks which can be reminiscent of free brushstrokes using the method of direct painting known as \u2018alla prima,\u2019 which is a characteristic of his oil painting of this period.  Compared with his contemporary Rembrandt\u2019s portraits that exhibit solid and elegant tastes, the Hals\u2019s portrait conveys a sense of real existence of a model as if its breathing can actually be felt directly. He succeeded at skillfully depicting the emotion and personality of the model in this portrait. The inscription on the upper right of the background shows the model\u2019s age and the date of the creation written together. Such a way of inscription is often seen in Hals\u2019s portraits. Therefore, from this inscription, we can know that this model was 73 years old. The color palettes based on dark tones and the free, spontaneous brushstrokes\u2014which were developed in the Netherlands in the 17th century\u2014seem to foresee the art of Manet, a father of the French Impressionism, that would emerge two centuries later"}, {"title": "The Slaughter of the Innocents", "artist": "Nicolas Poussin", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8_K5UmkR-KKmTlofMpNnujwMVAPeN13o86YOelSP82_Zf7adANQgwihhWjbsemL9j0JrIiEhk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Balthazar's banquet", "artist": "Giovanni Battista Merano", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_tFZXAJf_vLrTEQQ7OMQiTa2omrdAeAuocsn7Vd-T4nYri77qKbv7dRCz6d4aFR9i6ivkX6zo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Still Life of Flowers, Fruit, Shells, and Insects", "artist": "Balthasar van der Ast", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_qeYppnFvCDcpU6eEhYp_55gULq2jcabCQrQkTuA9EphKAj8XtW2E4DAkSG6QyoCdaJ52UDw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of a Woman, Probably Susanna Lunden (Susanna Fourment, 1599\u20131628)", "artist": "Peter Paul Rubens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_euyAg12g5QS2iQDnV0Cv7oSDn025ywX2Mc1wR24Xfr-Og2_V1YZjcF1gcrGK2GA0JL3ee9rhb", "desc": null}, {"title": "Young Man Singing", "artist": "Dirck van Baburen", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM89fOfNakpKqVg1jnlvTo4bAKX4uni4v1gbHkzncZ5eSHq8SnNeEHLLLgCACp7HIit8NYcdF7Y", "desc": null}, {"title": "Plate 3: Alexander Instructing his Soliders, from The Deeds of Alexander the Great", "artist": "Antonio Tempesta", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-2BdtB7Gzynr2nT0z2MBN1yUmcj9-C6AtpmKKr0uKrZm9NEuyRGiNESUNYVFZC22LCfmbRgw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Bust of an Old Bearded Man, Looking Down, Three-Quarters Right", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8YL8Ngt1eCzp1Rk20ceVHuKDKTXL880485JHr3hhUEjex0lTbf-nL_vhaanuKnkdpbVmv3ndc", "desc": null}, {"title": "De kaartspelers", "artist": "Both, Andries", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8pbkygtmStE1Hkddwb1aTECqIowN3LUFDbVBS0G_PoNk0kqkZ99uqsFKJU1BqRGiV1e17t1w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Estuary at Day's End", "artist": "Simon de Vlieger", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9xw58xQSA0qf1PiHkMpGPj353EkUtIfLYH-RY_LLZQLptIOzNn4AMhiG2Ox87f-zsMzEMbew", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portret van Philips Willem (1554-1618), prins van Oranje", "artist": "Mierevelt, Michiel Jansz. van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9GMkzZPCQhPKcRKW26_7rghMc-9TTBl5tXAbifzLXhHO97Gv3qFI7wkE5IxokgYbH7ifbg4nQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Cycnus and Hyrie", "artist": "Antonio Tempesta", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_ibUIj4Y7jc4FLI-NV8SEpt8pM_6QOEfbOmsxCXBHgV41hI4ZvDdLxHl7qRvAbIorZ-W6BzgE", "desc": null}, {"title": "De zieken bezoeken", "artist": "Sweerts, Michael", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9aDPcqJeMINJKTjwOO9IikUAZ5ktjpAgkOWkK10Wo9I7gqopxl179U55Dfb6kJRt-kJHpfxw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The King Governs by Himself", "artist": "Charles Le Brun", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_QS2Izj7IUhFme9NUUimTXMY03AqehoYTiE48p7HsapWkkEtUGvKTGeNXhhPO46BrxWQJ9aHaq", "desc": "This painting was \u201cthe principal key to everything\u201d.

He has literally stripped the Baptist of nearly all traditional attributes (halo, lamb and banderole inscribed Ecce Agnus Dei or Behold the Lamb of God) leaving the brooding intensity of the saints emotional state as the subject of the painting. Saint Johns solemn pensiveness is reinforced by a Caravaggio trademark: the dramatic contrast of deep, opaque shadows, playing across his body and shrouding the sockets of his eyes, with a bright light that illuminates the Baptist from above and to his right. This stark contrast of light and darkness, the brilliant scarlet of the saints cloak and Caravaggios placement of him in the foreground, close to our own space, all contribute to the dramatic impact of the painting. Evidence of Caravaggios working method, in which he incised lines into the gesso ground to guide his hand while painting, can be easily seen along the sitters left leg in the right corner.

In addition to hundreds of works of ancient sculpture, the collection included fifteen pictures by Caravaggio alone, among them The Crowning with Thorns. It is mentioned in the collection inventory as a supraporte, a painting destined to be hung over a doorway, and indeed the half-length composition is painted with slight fore shortening. Caravaggio\u2019s interest in the sculpture of antiquity, which he developed particularly during his stay in Rome in the period before 1606, is evident in the bent posture of Christ. There is a relationship with a particular model: the Belvedere Torso, which was mentioned for the first time in the 15th century and went on display at the Vatican sometime around 1530. With a complete command of anatomy, Caravaggio characterises the varied physical appearance of the protagonists. Christ\u2019s delicate skin is in obvious contrast to the bronzed appearance of his tormentors. His exposed, outstretched neck, which has been forced into a horizontal position, is a clear indication of the brutality of the action. Caravaggio uses decisive contrasts of light and dark to create a strong physical presence. Remarkable is his use of so-called incision, in which he used a sharp instrument to outline the principal contours of his composition on the surface before he began painting. It is not clear whether he did this free-hand or with the help of a pattern drawn on paper."}, {"title": "Die vier Evangelisten", "artist": "Peter Paul Rubens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9wYePdwyfLzYd_8KBd3ZTEaWkN8RmQz1yHQcOITTQC2PpH3NItg39h8udA67zthxnvpmwdzCMe", "desc": "Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) zeigt die vier Evangelisten Lukas, Matth\u00e4us, Markus und Johannes in dem Moment des Empfangens g\u00f6ttlicher Inspiration, die sie zum Verfassen der Evangelien bewegt. Sie sind um einen Tisch gruppiert und werden mit ihren traditionellen Attributen wiedergegeben: Lukas mit dem Stier, Matth\u00e4us mit dem Engel, Markus mit dem L\u00f6wen und Johannes mit dem Adler. Als Zeugen des Lebens Jesu nehmen die Evangelisten eine zentrale Stellung in der Vermittlung der christlichen Lehre ein und wurden in der Kunst h\u00e4ufig dargestellt. In der niederl\u00e4ndischen Malerei ist Rubens Bild eines der wenigen Gem\u00e4lde, das alle vier Evangelisten gemeinsam in einer Szene zeigt. H\u00e4ufiger sind einfigurige Darstellungen der einzelnen Evangelisten. Das Gem\u00e4lde entstand nur wenige Jahre nach Rubens Italienaufenthalt (1600-1608). Dort hatte er Skizzen nach Werken der Antike und der italienischen Renaissance angefertigt, die seine sp\u00e4teren Arbeiten beeinflussten. Werke des fl\u00e4mischen Malers Peter Paul Rubens geh\u00f6rten im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert neben denjenigen der Hauptmeister der italienischen Renaissance zu den kostspieligsten Gem\u00e4lden, die auf dem damaligen Kunstmarkt zu finden waren. Sie waren beliebte Sammlerst\u00fccke, die in kaum einer bedeutenden f\u00fcrstlichen Kunstsammlung fehlten. Auch Friedrich II. von Preu\u00dfen lie\u00df f\u00fcr die Einrichtung der Bildergalerie zahlreiche gro\u00dfformatige Werke des K\u00fcnstlers erwerben und zahlte hierf\u00fcr teilweise H\u00f6chstpreise. Bereits bei der Ersteinrichtung der Bildergalerie 1764 konnten insgesamt 38 Gem\u00e4lde gez\u00e4hlt werden, die als Werke von Rubens pr\u00e4sentiert wurden. Nicht alle Zuschreibungen hielten jedoch dem sp\u00e4teren Urteil stand. Im Laufe der Jahrhunderte wurden viele Gem\u00e4lde Sch\u00fclern von Rubens bzw. dessen Werkstatt zugeschrieben. Heute werden noch sieben Gem\u00e4lde von Rubens in der Bildergalerie gezeigt. Die \"Vier Evangelisten\", die seit 1763 in der Bildergalerie nachweisbar sind, galten bis ins ausgehende 19.

As the term denotes, the style used by Dou and his numerous followers involved meticulous brushwork, close observation of objects, and a high degree of finish to the extent that the surfaces of their pictures look almost as if they have been polished. A girl chopping onions is on a minute scale and is a perfect demonstration of the art of fijnschilders painting. The activities of kitchenmaids was one of Dous favourite themes, in which he could not only indulge in brilliant passages of still-life painting, but also pursue artistic themes. Lascivious kitchenmaids were frequently the subject of comedic literature in seventeenth-century Holland, and painters emphasised their charms by the use of symbolism based on contemporary emblem books or proverbs. Thus, the empty bird-cage may be an allusion to loss of virtue and the dead fowl is a double entendre - the Dutch word vogel (bird) was also a slang term for copulation. Many of the utensils in the picture - such as the candle, pestle and mortar, and the jug - have clear sexual connotations. In addition, the kitchenmaid looks straight out at the viewer whilst suggestively engaged in chopping onions, which in the seventeenth century were used as an aphrodisiac. All these disparate aspects, however, might be united in a wider meaning personified by the two figures: the small boy standing for innocence and the girl for experience. Yet this was not how it was interpreted when the picture was in France during the eighteenth century. When engraved by Pierre Louis Surugue the following caption was supplied as imaginary dialogue between the small boy (perhaps seen as Cupid) and the young woman: I am perfectly willing to believe that you are knowledgeable in the delectable art of preparing stews / But I feel even more appetite for you / Than for the stew that you are preparing. The motif of chopping onions first occurred in The Kitchen of c.1645 (Staatens Museum, Copenhagen) in which the same small boy also appears. The view into the kitchen is here made possible by the raised curtain which Dutch artists began to use during the 1640s as an illusionistic device. As might be expected of such a tour-de-force, A girl chopping onions was in several famous French collections during the eighteenth century - Gaignat, Choiseul (when engraved), Prince de Conti, Choiseul-Praslin - before entering the collection of Jan Gildemeester in Amsterdam and the Baring collection in London; it was acquired from the latter by George IV.

The simplicity of this domestic scene encourages the viewer to delight in the beauty and detail of the objects that it contains. The interaction between the three participants is left open to interpretation and the significance of the letter is not explained. Ter Borch delights in metallic surfaces, for instance the reflections in the candelabrum and the inkwell and stand. The use of deep blue ultramarine edging around the womans neckline and the rendering of the embroidery around the edge of her skirt are masterly touches. Similarly, the painting of the womans silk skirt, which is in excellent condition, is a passage of mesmerising beauty. At the end of the eighteenth century The Letter belonged to the Amsterdam merchant and art collector Jan Gildemeester. In the painting of his art gallery by Adriaan de Lelie (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), The Letter can clearly be seen hanging on the left-hand wall.

De Hooch was part of an artistic movement that was later called the Delftschool: another member was Johannes Vermeer, three years younger than de Hooch and more prominent today. This type of usually small format painting of an interior became a fixed part of the local artistic repertoire. There is also a characteristic manner of dealing with light: both de Hooch and Vermeer used soft illumination, bathing their paintings in a gentle, flattering light. De Hooch painted the present work during his time in Amsterdam (starting in 1660), where he specialised in depicting the style of home furnishings and life typical of the city\u2019s well-situated citizens. Despite the presence of a serving maid, the elegantly clad mother is caring personally for her infant; she does not waste money on a wet-nurse. Across the spotless tile floor, we look into a second room at the back, then through the half-open door to a house on a canal and the city beyond. A fire is burning on the hearth, providing a colourful accent that recurs in the infant\u2019s clothing and the sunlit view. In a similarly rhythmic fashion, the red of the fabric drying on the hearth is repeated at several points in the picture, giving the composition a balance of colour. This scene makes clear the understanding of (ideal) roles at the time: attentive childcare and a well-run household are a woman\u2019s province. Thus the opening to the city, which makes sense from a compositional point of view, also has symbolic character: the outside world is a man\u2019s domain, but the female sphere always remains open to him."}, {"title": "De blinde Tobias: schets", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_2a9TkCGQhcUjnBGlhduLYLovH8fyYLM1MoFztwG8mXqNjpq6VhvxyTwIgTDPoxFiY5yip", "desc": null}, {"title": "Vase of Flowers with a Curtain", "artist": "Jacques de Gheyn II", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-O99riWLkeAYJiqJeidTOWhw9WRLzSgvlMX_mbZRxNXPpVOko79Hf5LArgrUgi-7Zc7DOw4w", "desc": "Jacques de Gheyn II was one of the founders of the tradition of flower painting in the Netherlands.

With no experience but a brief apprenticeship in a pastry-cooks at home, there were gaps in his education, to say the least, and he never learnt Italian properly; yet the fashionable, urbane aristocracy adored him, and his pictures were so admired that there was a considerable business forging them. In spite of being a reserved dreamer he attained unparalleled success in the capital of intrigue and envy. He tamed even the archfoe of glory, time: the greatest landscapists of the nineteenth century - the British Turner, or the Hungarian Mark\u00f3, still chased Claudes mellow sunlight. For this is the secret of Claudes art: sunlight which permeates all and gives life. Whether he paints imaginary antique harbours, or the Campagna, the plains surrounding Rome, it is the light which clothes the view in the radiance of the Golden Age, and lends a cosmic dimension to modest settings. It seems as though Virgils ancient idylls have come to life, though the Renaissance castles dominating the area are much more recent. The castle in this drawing is the famous La Crescenza, which often features in Claudes pictures, and following his example later artists (such as Corot) were also fond of painting it. Some believe the painting shows the same castle too, but this building, though assembled from familiar elements, is a product of the imagination."}, {"title": "Dona Mariana of Austria, Queen of Spain", "artist": "Diego Rodriguez de Silva", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-4ic2lBd1i5Y1yXd5kxrGpqIHKiQPAK-tcySkA94KhY9c_m2sBwCAVFrqR1WCK8LzzCUVVaw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Adoration of the Shepherds", "artist": "Jacob Jordaens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8VEvMebQbEB8xTy5HQ6WxXsZglFXCas_KfFG5jy4EYcZQyJbrIr-B_BXhSg3D_MxzGU2k6CA", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Adoration of the Golden Calf", "artist": "Andrea Vaccaro", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_EXvgL4zrWhv8a4uNXS9QAlrqAH08NSGqfDgCqSb6h66mg8gvidlPsKXHkN7QrTDiLZyecpA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Satyr Playing the Pipe (Jupiter's Childhood) (fragment)", "artist": "Jacob Jordaens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-apAsxXfRHfSfBbSr3TAIUcxX7jYdLhCIAsMcDzNQ3PBRqedt034cHfUj5to0JY2JK13Hibho", "desc": null}, {"title": "Beggar Man and Beggar Woman Conversing", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-aUrgVSCvIYTGgLqFZBQqE3eMVkkljTgnw3Wos47eX5Ju3OXz1qiVNYsNsrbSUTqB828DbMA", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Shell (Conus Marmoreus)", "artist": "Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8j_c_I1H0VYbhJ4MONfY4b223XpYaj9tcHGgy9CZRezX1nN17mTVNqmzeVJ5YvTvWl_I7ksB4", "desc": null}, {"title": "Destruction of a Convent", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-MSiZUD8BNO4HxfuZFBevPzGKnJHSPOwDObjoUnYd6UX_rAOZtSR89xu8R8whD1yLlFIiOLg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Interior of the Buurkerk, Utrecht", "artist": "Pieter Jansz.

In place of a crown, he wears a large velvet artists beret. He holds a painters stick as though it were a scepter. Yet this feeling of uneasy confrontation diminishes as we study the face. The wariness and impatience seem like a veil shadowing the mans real expression, which is blurred and scarred\u2014by time, by sorrows, and illness. Yet Rembrandt was only fifty-two in 1658 when he signed and dated this portrait. He was also a small man, but he portrayed his figure in monumental dimensions.

Since the realist theory of painting had expanded unilaterally during this period, there is the mistaken view that only Dutch-type landscapes existed in 17th century Dutch painting. In fact, the Italianate style landscape was extremely popular in Holland at that time, and records reveal that such paintings were quite expensive. Reflecting this state of affairs, there is an Italianate mood in the landscape shown here.\tWhile a small work, this painting ably reveals Boths characteristic methods. The careful brush work and expression of the densely clumped trees and plants suggest a relatively early production date (1640s), while the bright sky that expands across the upper right of the composition gives the painting a particularly lyrical mood. This lyricism is further heightened by the presence of nude nymphs in the foreground. These nymphs probably are related to some subject, but given that there are no specific clues present, it is hard to assign a particular subject to the work. Subjects that would involve the presence of several nymphs scattered in a landscape include the tales of Diana and Callisto, but while the nymphs here recall such tales, it seems that the work is mainly an experiment in freer landscape depiction. This painting, with its gentle sunlight, mythological subject and lyrical landscape setting all work together to form a landscape diametrically opposed to the reality of Holland at the time.

The scriptural source for this scene is the Gospel of St John (20:11-18), who describes in some detail the burial and subsequent resurrection of Christ following the Crucifixion. Mary Magdalene returns to the tomb early the next morning, only to find the stone at the entrance removed and two angels inside it where the body should have been. She then fetches two of the disciples, who check that the tomb is empty and then leave her. The angels then ask Mary Magdalene, Woman, why weepest thou? and she replies, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. At that moment she turns round and sees a man dressed as a gardener, not appreciating that he is the resurrected Christ. She appeals to him for information, but he calls her by her name and she instantly recognises him. (Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say master.) Rembrandt has depicted the moment of realisation just before the actual recognition. Most artists chose to paint the next moment in the text, when Mary Magdalene reaches out towards Jesus and he forestalls her with the words Touch me not (in Latin, Noli me tangere). Rembrandt skilfully evokes the dawn as the opalescent light picks out from the darkness the towers of the Temple of Jerusalem, the upper half of the figure of Christ, the face of Mary Magdalene, and the outline of one of the angels in the tomb. This use of light is almost symbolic in both the physical and the spiritual senses. The paint is in general thinly applied and, apart from the treatment of the light and the vegetation around the tomb referring to Christs activities as a gardener), could almost be described as monochrome. It is only after a time that the eye focuses on the two female figures (the Gospels of St Mark and St Luke refer to three Maries at the tomb) in the middle distance on the left descending the hill. Of particular note is the positioning of Christ, who in the relationship established between his partially silhouetted vertical form and the Temple of Jerusalem behind and the rocky cave next to him dominates the composition, whereas the twisting pose of Mary Magdalene is the pivot. The tension created between Christs standing figure and the twisting kneeling Mary Magdalene is palpable. The artists only other treatment of the subject of Christ and Mary Magdalene is in Brunswick (Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum): it is dated 1651 and is totally different in composition.

He portrayed himself against a crumbling wall and scratched his signature into the wet paint. Fabritius was born in the village of Middenbeemster in the Dutch province of North Holland and studied under Rembrandt. This information comes from the Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst (1678) by Samuel van Hoogstraten, another of Rembrandt\u2019s pupils. Fabritius\u2019 earliest known paintings are entirely consistent with his teacher\u2019s style as regards both the composition and his rendering of figures. Like Rembrandt\u2019s, they are vigorously painted, with strong contrasts between light and shade. In 1650, Fabritius moved to Delft, where he developed a more colourful style. In the Self-Portrait Rembrandt\u2019s influence can be seen in the broad manner of painting. The light background, however, suggests that it was made close to, or after 1645. Fabritius painted a second self-portrait in 1654, in which Rembrandt\u2019s influence is less explicit.

Thus the donor seeking protection at St. Dominic\u2019s elbow at the left edge of the painting remains unidentified. According to the latest research, the picture was painted in Naples rather than in Rome and thus in the period between 1601 and 1605. Its existence is first documented in 1607, when it was already being put up for sale in Naples. The owners, two Dutch art dealers, returned to Amsterdam with the painting sometime before 1617. There it was acquired in 1618/19 by an Antwerp consortium, to which Rubens and Jan Brueghel the EIder belonged, before it finally found a new home in Antwerp\u2019s Dominican Church. In 1781 the Madonna of the Rosary was acquired for the imperial collection of paintings at the instigation of Emperor Joseph II. Pope Gregory XIII instituted the Feast of the Holy Rosary in 1573, following the victory of the allied Christian forces over the Turkish fleet at Lepanto (1571), and entrusted the Dominican order with its observance. St. Peter Martyr, who can be recognised by his wounded head, turns as holy mediator towards the viewer. He indicates to the faithful the presence of the enthroned Madonna with the child Jesus. She, on the other hand, turns to the side, ordering St. Dominic, who is looking up in obedience, to distribute rosaries to the people who are pressing towards him on their knees. But ultimately even Mary plays only the role of a mediator \u2013 the boy Jesus is the focus of attention with regards to both content and composition. As in most of his works, Caravaggio achieves the strong physical presence of the figures in a realistic, never idealising manner through the use of intense contrasts of light and dark. He subtly makes the objects of their desire, the rosaries, more abstract by putting them in the shadows, making the brightly illuminated hands all the more dominant."}, {"title": "Venus Clipping the Wings of Cupid (ca. 1655)", "artist": "Charles Le Brun", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_fbW0l7PbCVrqgQ2heG8Boou5-6Ho4el6-aaEorJ1pkmNvbAupLHeCh2bEljpbo3aPaHf_-A", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ships of Amsterdam", "artist": "Reinier Zeeman", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9XDbljW_1FLxLNezb8s15ubVx_sBxc-rtK-h4hZyZVHEM_HYcWxY08DhXFxvmeMJmMDki1kfc", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Girl with a Broom", "artist": "Rembrandt", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_CTB_JKHAcU-JF09YTJfAjmA56RVQiUDUQyh7-9MWtS0gL34HBGWI3JKNnXtr-B7kw1wF38AmF", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Pissing Man", "artist": "Adriaen van Ostade", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9nB-XVZatq4x1jvfPIdas-Q40vWMpwhEZ_bH5sEEPjrC4lBXWVOZaBmaIHw-05-ZKb8H6T-9I", "desc": null}, {"title": "Study of a Rearing Horse", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_DCwW-wSYt13xuzrSZFyUglPLRD5-zkPXX_JXIAQYbYQQWh3GYGs5sBtNF46m44aNScVFzYO0", "desc": "This powerful image clearly displays Jacques Callot developing the motif of a rearing horse.

First, he would take measurements and make sketches of buildings on site; these would then be used to produce detailed construction drawings in the studio. Finally, after several years, he would complete the oil paintings, transferring his delicate drawings to the appropriate support. In this way Saenredam sought to create impeccable portraits of buildings, though his quest for perfection occasionally led him to modify reality. The solid, monumental quality of his work is conveyed through simple, bright architectural settings and the use of a palette of pale colours for lighting purposes"}, {"title": "Self-Portrait with Saskia", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9jNPfH-rEYPhk46dF-2R16rbS8LRNwUKl3dv7YkWDh5I-49LaMS1mEj-GXmZ7p1ZGZTOC_FnrZ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Laughing Boy", "artist": "Hals", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9cY2lOqDkbqKDMJmoFkdA1jtamgxGNYQfnztZzOsSAv-rEJk9ikVgC86gnQIOaMJSWwYqnrw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Vision of the Blessed Hermann Joseph", "artist": "Anton van Dyck", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-RqEPYCKjYKJw0OKyfHwAuKdx2qzHVTMcSmSxuNi8MTSQ7MarKrZKmKjGd95ZYARc6NjQNLffX", "desc": "After spending several years in Italy, where he acquired a refined knowledge of Venetian painting, Anthony van Dyck returned to Antwerp in 1627. He joined the Jesuit Confraternity of Bachelors and in 1630 was appointed \u2013 as Rubens had been decades earlier \u2013 court painter to Isabella Clara Eugenia, the regent of the Spanish Netherlands. During this period he created two altarpieces for thebrotherhood: Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints Rosalia, Peter and Paul (KHM, GG 482) in 1629, and, immediately afterwards, this slightly smaller painting. The legend of the Premonstratensian monk Hermann Joseph (ca. 1200) was probably chosen as the subject for the altarpiece because the head of the brotherhood at the time shared his name. The monk\u2019s vision of his marriage to the Madonna was the pinnacle of his pronounced worship of the Virgin Mary. Deep affection, devotion and emotion mark the posture, gestures and face of the kneeling monk, while the Madonna appears distant, superior and cool. The smiling angel, with his right arm and shoulder exposed, takes on the role of the mediator both with regards to composition and content. All emotions seem to be concentrated in his billowing robe. Helpfully, he has taken the monk\u2019s hand and is gently leading it towards the Madonna\u2019s fingertips. In comparison to similar compositions by Rubens, who was 22 years older and in whose studio van Dyck had worked in his youth, the younger painter emphasises the aspects of emotion mainly with gentle movements, using soft, broken coloration; thus the emotional interaction between the protagonists gains in importance. The suggestion that the figure at the left edge of the picture is a self-portrait of van Dyck remains unproven. In any case, he was no longer so youthful when the painting was executed.

Around 1632 he moved to Amsterdam, quickly establishing himself as the town\u2019s leading artist, specializing in history paintings and portraiture. He received many commissions and attracted a number of students who came to learn his method of painting.Throughout his life Rembrandt was fascinated by the apostle Paul, perhaps because Paul\u2019s writings were the most important source for Reformation theology, or perhaps because he personified the Christian ideal of grace received independently of merit. Sitting at a table in his prison cell, the apostle ponders the words he is about to write in the epistle that lies before him. The solemn expression of Paul\u2019s strong features underscores the depth of his belief and sense of purpose in his mission to spread Christianity to the heathens. The sword visible above the book is as much the \"sword of the Spirit,\" the term he used to describe the word of God in his letter to the Ephesians, as it is the symbol of his military prowess before his conversion and the sign of his eventual beheading and martyrdom. The gentle light that illuminates Paul\u2019s head, hand, and epistle has no defined point of origin.

A soft ermine cape is painted so realistically that the viewer can see the indentations left by Saint-Albins fingers as they press against the fur"}, {"title": "Saint Paul", "artist": " For more information about this and thousands of other works of art in the NGA collection, please visit\u00a0http://www.nga.gov/", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9n8kQnc6TPdihnB9RZSYHqs5s04ooC0SohZrR3RxXDutCxR7rNnqgYIIYRJ4I6VZyIXd1Owsw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Still Life with Grapes and Game", "artist": "Frans Snyders", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8xJs3LJBQiIoCAqDyLd-Qk_uTQk5FySATAN7GqEPwOFMSMT6I1Ace9Yp-5P8rQFaHqMYG64to", "desc": null}, {"title": "Slapend hondje", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_HIoku0sDmx0I-LYEGN_cC6qMIentf-Z1AdHyozrJE6iSDZhQ2_yPvl5JEZibGDwU7RkslLDc", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christ Appearing to the Apostles", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8TnjmnuAIp11p5YWXw3mwV-g84wHvRIghqhSEGt-Po9OlkaF9EggOjgEugT9xPN8eLYZRik64", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hieronymus, lezend in een Italiaans landschap", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_8RVfilHPDe7zIRaHoQ3PRzYy_ixRN7zqrWmrDA_cju-1NueT4uD3SMDOX4316f0chG0H0rg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Maid at the Window", "artist": "Gerard Dou", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8M4CRczvjbBVdmogOfOAyusKwYyMeipXP_sIfvbCTJobO3_EoBuI0zROJrlEw7saMh3rHJQA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Country House in a Park", "artist": "Jacob van Ruisdael", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-4STO6sU-sS0UFMVTq0XaKNahYODtNmUJunECmmQKzKLw7NBZGKDgrz-kiEGMSEjU8IsyEhKA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Plate 19: a Polish nobleman in court dress, standing in center, seen from behind, another nobleman to right in background, from 'Diversi capricci'", "artist": "Stefano della Bella", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_XZ6cMiu-cnhy9br8ZwXzpNhOl9ThA7fANn_hLMKM0A77-h8rwzzFvLshPY_3ID_adyy-yv0MI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Boerderij aan een vaart: gezicht op Ouderkerk aan de Amstel", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-rks_Xgrc7cpoOnucgH0G7bGOc0Pr68QAvuKLbZyBVFQuE5lTd9lTolAgx1LBTFN5NR7JZumuv", "desc": null}, {"title": "Slag tussen Spanje en Portugal", "artist": "Stoop, Dirk", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9jrhU3uF5QJ53QPaAtMrRKpx2X1EeGiwdevg9c134Ihg1hi6A78GyhSn0sE-aZvXkiZCXwDw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Brazilian Landscape", "artist": "oil", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9oW2ESZjDAZVaCHWfTF6X1pUxm79zhld5Rp0z2CRFsTFrkF9jRQtPw-gBuyB9xP9Pgvffxl1Y", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ornatus Muliebris Anglicanus (De kleding van Engelse vrouwen)", "artist": "Hollar, Wenceslaus", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-fN2zcYYEDE4X0i2ckeU3xLmZyScLVGh68zVXplbcBKGNrGnogVjyKS34mc00ky9YxnSD2", "desc": null}, {"title": "Het dronken paar", "artist": "Steen, Jan Havicksz", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Wm-_nEG5unXpBnAm_9R8da8zBOwX5CjT6nTohSpJm2HtZKtXmdvkbLGc5NPH7b4WEhCKZD-3g", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Hanging", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-4qrZovvLAt7LX3IW5IG2eXiEwnbtxeQLpd_6jlLTzPWsXrf5hXeGDmxyEcN_RIQIZGzdhmIU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Oude man met lange baard", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_IdrAbevakJhqw7MKg8XzLCV077ZZBd2JSg9xOff42EUj6Sgg7O1QydW8WwNzGTOzZs88Z_4U", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christ Healing the Sick", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-JAHcNxqqsuoxIJpoxun7SLg7NP18kvr8JGgvGWt2qP4BiInzGbk_RHglccVaAv_YFzA-Yg-A", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Young Woman seated at a Virginal", "artist": "Johannes Vermeer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-FuQPUTQNWkmXY_0FjiuBOZZCjoBz35NDShJdIwR9-MlFvZqBTYt7fi18LASofLacsK8JBJw", "desc": "In the left foreground rests a viola da gamba with the bow placed in between the strings.

Cyrus of Persia, seen at the center, asked his confidant Daniel why he does not worship the deity Bel, whose lower half can be seen in the shadows, Daniel replied that he worshipped a living god, not an idol. The king insisted that Bel was a living god and pointed to the offerings of food and wine that Bel consumed every night. Cautiously, Daniel noted that bronze statues do not eat. Cyrus was momentarily bewildered, but the worried faces of the priests in the background confirm that Daniel has exposed their deception. This story of Daniels dramatic exposure of the kings idol-worship derives from the apocryphal portion of the Book of Daniel.  Light illuminates the figures of Cyrus and Daniel, highlighting their dramatic encounter. Rembrandt contrasted the kings grandeur with Daniels humility. Facing out and gesturing toward the table, the lavishly attired Cyrus appears large and imposing. By contrast, the youthful Daniel seems small, and his posture suggests modesty or submissiveness before his ruler. Rembrandt evoked the exotic mystery of a pagan cult by showing only part of the monumental idol emerging from the flickering lamplight on the right.

Pieter de Molijn was not concerned with painting a specific landscape, but with creating a mood: the sun shines, there are clouds \u2013 but not threatening ones \u2013 in the sky; in short it is a peaceful day. The artist has used several tried and tested tricks of the trade. The path is bathed in sunlight, for example, while the foreground and background are in shade, thus creating depth. He also used a composition of diagonals: the two paths that cross in the painting lead the eye into the distance. Pieter de Molijn, born in London of Flemish parents, lived and worked in Haarlem, the  cradle of the typical Dutch landscape in painting. He played a not insignificant part in the development of landscape as a genre. Around 1626 he became one of the first people to stress the creation of mood.

As frequently happens in the work of Carracci, the figures are kept relatively small in relation to the overall area, while great importance is given to the landscape. The light, which allows the unusual local colours to shine out directly over broad areas of the picture, is familiar from other works by Carracci, and so is the romantic, fantastic night atmosphere, which makes the painting seem strangely modern. The figures of the angels, delicately elongated and standing out effectively against the dark forest ground, also contribute to the eerie atmosphere; they have faces typical of Ludovicos style, with over-large eyes, long, narrow noses and low brows. An unusual number of them are trying to help the Messiah, who is at the beginning of his public mission; he has just resisted the temptations of the Devil, who is disappearing into the sky at the top left.

The images of the two altarpieces, like theatre scenery, had to be changeable in accordance with the church year, and thus a complicated mechanism was required. Franciscus Aguilonius, rector of the Jesuit Seminary since 1613, wanted to promote the canonisation of the founder of the Jesuit Order, Ignatius of Loyola (KHM, GG 530 and 517), and Francis Xavier with monumental altarpieces. It was traditional workshop procedure for Rubens to first create a modello. This small-format version served as a model for further co-ordination with the client and was the basis for the execution of the large-format painting by Rubens and his studio. In 1541 Francis Xavier was sent to Eastern India, Malacca, Ceylon, Japan and Singapore to perform missionary work. He is depicted in the present sketch in front of a partly fascinated, partly sceptical audience, some of them dressed in seemingly oriental clothing. A blind man is standing to the right of the protagonist\u2019s feet, while people who have been brought back from the dead can be seen to his left. A heathen temple with falling idols dominates the background. Rubens combined these pictorial images in a flowing, exciting and mature composition in the modello, but the differences between the sketch and the large-format painting (KHM GG 519) are nonetheless interesting. With the aim of making the composition more legible when viewed from a distance, Rubens made several changes, most of them regarding the protagonist. In the finished painting Francis Xavier occupies a more isolated and thus more powerful position. Another interesting detail is the mother holding her lifeless child in her arms at the left edge of the sketch. In the painting Rubens depicted the infant in prone position with water running from its mouth, thus making its death by drowning clear to the viewer."}, {"title": "A nobreza de Lorena: o guerreiro com o grande chap\u00e9u ornado de plumas", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_tgsDvGsZR7W2XSgs-igTRRJRGCwOrLF4dVOMvMsdQI2IOXYxtW-ctvlSFpPryxAO3kf2Rgg", "desc": null}, {"title": "The chariot of Saturn between Justice and Piety", "artist": " Versailles collections", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM82bJuzoHmXzmo-C_3wVHnvHGo8PiRs5H9zZMhK_IFs4nnrxgL1Nu7lCxpC_38-7rz3TOucyQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Two Bulls Fighting", "artist": "Hendrik Hondius I", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Q_sGmmoFdPKabmIVEjWplf0s8ITqV8PECAy1BZKHJskpS5hYdZlnqhIZ1Jcgk0_AQNPZvouw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Still Life with Flowers and Gold Cups of Honour", "artist": "Clara Peeters", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_O0rVK8okwZoXHkQcbv6xUEb0FLyh873el1CNMh-QVxvw5CcmqkGxHqjogHH_jq6aaL0vyT6Y", "desc": "Clara Peeters was a Flemish painter of the 17th century and famous for her still lifes.

Elderly and bearded, he is humbly dressed and appears to bear the weight of his calling on his slender walking staff. He gazes at the message borne aloft by the heavenly host with a look of reverent awe and dutiful acceptance.

Most of the animal is outlined with a long thin line. Rembrandt used black chalk in short broken strokes to convey the texture of the elephants rough wrinkled skin, the ragged ear and curling trunk. In the darkest shadows of the ear and neck he used charcoal to reinforce their depth, an unusual technique for the artist. The elephants trunk and the family have a broader outline, almost rendering them abstract.While Rembrandt drew animals for use in his paintings and etchings, this charming elephant does not appear in any known work.

This work is thought to have been painted when the artist was about 34 years old. The rendering of light from the left and against a dark background is typical of the superb Carravaggist expression of the Neapolitan school. The subject tells the tale of Hercules, who has completed his twelve labors and is set to work spinning thread for the Lydian queen Omphale. It seems that the hero, confident in his physical prowess, is troubled by the womens work of spinning thread, and he becomes the butt of jokes in the face of his inability to carry out what was a simple task for the women of the day. This meeting between Hercules and Omphale led them to fall in love, but the uneasy expression on the face of Amore, seen in the shadows, suggests the unfortunate outcome of such love. The influence of Jusepe de Ribera can be seen in the roughhewn depiction of Herculess body. Unlike the mathematically logical spatial compositions of the Renaissance, this painting reveals the strong influence of Caravaggio, in a Baroque space alive with contrasting light and darkness and pigments.

In this work, painted around 1623, a good eight years after Jordaens had become a free master, the painter is at peak of his career. Nothing remains of the clumsiness of his youthful work. Whether the eye stays on the anatomy or the expressions of the figures, on their rhythmic ordering or their gestures, or enjoys the creamy, confident paint strokes or the alternation between the golden light and the transparent shadows, or is tempted by the rich colours of the opulent fruits: everywhere it senses the same impressive harmony. The life-size figures, allowing only a glimpse of the landscape to show through, unfold like a sculpted frieze on both sides of a female nude, seen from behind, standing slightly off-centre and so introducing a certain dynamism into the composition. Her nakedness catches the full light and draws the viewer\u2019s attention. A golden glow strokes her skin, in which nothing reminds us of the cold stone from which her sculptural monumentality initially seems to originate. Rather, as a nymph she belongs, together with her female companions and the satyrs surrounding her, to the category of beings between humans, gods and animals which in antiquity embodied the untameable powers of nature. The grapes that they are all gathering possibly symbolise the rich fertility of nature. The cornucopia on the far right is a reference to Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, which tells how it came into being when the horn of Achelous, metamorphosed into a bull, broke off in his fight with Hercules.

Poussins sketching campaigns in the Roman countryside with his friend and fellow landscape painter Claude Lorrain account, in part, for its fresh observation of cloud-scattered sky and grazing goats.Poussin painted a pendant to this painting, Landscape with a Storm,now in a museum in Rouen.

However, Cowley would have been around forty-years-old at the time this picture was painted, whereas the young shepherd cannot be much older than a teenager. Similarly, Mary Beale\u2019s portrait of her son Bartholomew was also mistakenly thought to represent Cowley.

Using a low viewpoint and dramatic foreshortening, Lanfranco depicted the figures as if seen from below, imbuing them with monumentality. The powerful composition communicated both to spectators standing far away and to viewers standing far beneath the painting. In the Old Testament story (Numbers 13:1-27), Moses sent spies into Canaan to determine whether the land bore fruit. Lanfranco depicted these spies as they returned, laden with grapes, pomegranates, and figs as signs of the plenty of the Promised Land.

The identity of the figure in the painting is, however, unknown. The rich costume that he is wearing gives no indication of the old mans occupation or social status. Rather, it appears to be an accessory belonging to the painters studio that he used as a powerfully effective decorative element.Rendered in a highly intimiste style, the work calls to mind other pieces by the artist in that it marries the simplicity of Dutch taste with the Italian predilection for warm colours. Realistic, expressive, psychologically dense and emotionally suggestive, the portrait reveals a new form of pictorial narration through which the spectator is given a sense of the spiritual space inhabited by the figure. This aspect is further highlighted by the painter\u2019s prodigious use of chiaroscuro.Like Pallas Athena, another painting by Rembrandt which Calouste Gulbenkian bought from the Hermitage Museum in 1930, this work formed part of the collection of Catherine II of Russia"}, {"title": "Jesus Tended by the Angels", "artist": "Giovanni Lanfranco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Fr6QIudzqUNH380SKfQ3UYngBn-pjM2CkM4RksYPI-I764Zo9ZIRtHwQwZkmwbMN536BMDg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Herdsmen by a fire", "artist": "Leonaert Bramer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_fgm60JZrm9p3hLJcOCSt9PojukMKn0WpWRcepnFbnr0FRaaIoWfcJ6_niSao32iEIR8ZzxlY", "desc": "We know of around 20 night scenes by the Delft artist Leonaert Bramer painted on slate, a highly unusual support.

The story is told in Apuleiuss Golden Ass, of the 2nd century AD: Psyche was a mortal so beautiful that Venus herself was envious, and the goddess sent Cupid to make her fall in love with someone worthless. But Cupid was himself captivated and so had Psyche brought to his palace, visiting her only after dark and forbidding her to cast eyes on him. Rubens depicted the moment that Psyche catches her first glimpse of Cupid; she is seated on the edge of the bed in which he sleeps, holding a lamp from which oil would drip and waken him. Rubens used a male model for the study, softening his musculature in the painting into the artists more familiar fleshy forms. The drawing owes much to Rubenss experiences in Italy (and Rome in particular), where he had spent most of the period 1600-08. The scale and media of the drawing are indebted to Annibale Carraccis studies for the Farnese Gallery, and the pose possibly had a source in one of the most frequently copied figures in Michelangelos Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel, at the centre of the right-hand group of the Saved.

"desc": "Peeter Gijsels ist ein typischer Vertreter des sogenannten Goldenen Zeitalters, jener Bl\u00fctezeit der niederl\u00e4ndischen Kunst im 17. Jahrhundert. Wirtschaftlicher Reichtum und die Entdeckung neuer Sujets f\u00fchrten zu einer wahren Bilderflut, was die Entstehung eines, dem heutigen Kunstbetrieb durchaus \u00e4hnlichen Kunstmarkts markierte. Kunst war fortan nicht mehr allein einer privilegierten Klasse vorbehalten. Auch einfache Leute konnten sich Druckgrafiken und Gem\u00e4lde, meist in kleineren Formaten, leisten. Durch ihre Rolle als See- und Handelsmacht entwickelte sich in den Niederlanden zudem ein besonderes Interesse an neuen und fremdartigen Dingen, die auf dem Seeweg aus fernen L\u00e4ndern mit in die Heimat gebracht wurden. In dem Gem\u00e4lde von Gijsels f\u00e4llt die F\u00fclle von fremdartigen Tieren, exotischem Obst und Gem\u00fcse ins Auge, woraus sich ableiten l\u00e4sst, dass es sich hier um eine symbolische Darstellung handelt. In dem Bild Palastterrasse mit Vertumnus und Pomona ist eine hexenartige Alte zu erkennen. Sie beugt sich zu einer entbl\u00f6\u00dften jungen Frau herab, die abwehrend ihre Hand erhebt. Es handelt sich um eine Geschichte aus Ovids Metamorphosen: Der wandlungsf\u00e4hige Vegetationsgott Vertumnus versucht, in der Gestalt einer alten Kupplerin die G\u00e4rtnerin Pomona zu verf\u00fchren, die M\u00e4nnern den Zugang zur ihrem Garten verwehrt. Mit dem Motiv des Gartens greift Gijsels auf den geschlossenen Garten (lateinisch: hortus conclusus) zur\u00fcck, der symbolisch f\u00fcr die Jungfr\u00e4ulichkeit Mariens steht. Im Gegensatz zur Geschichte Mariens scheint hier das Vorhaben zu gelingen, das legt zumindest der kleine Amor nahe, der hinter Vertumnus hervorlugt"}, {"title": "Circe changing the companions of Ulysses into beasts", "artist": "Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_MtvF86vfgNTauXtlZ2tv8XSVE20MRs3wVIQhpOtgzESays_XfYqWBmLO05eweoycmluFOWJU", "desc": null}, {"title": "The release of St Peter", "artist": "Bernardo Strozzi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9WfdN7syiohMKcE34f8YUbRAgb4Oe7UfknZ0CVT7O1_3vjgmkezo95E3fsh3OMBBOd3jKLmQ", "desc": "Bernardo Strozzis experience as a Capuchin monk only partly explains the certainties presented for contemplation in this master-ful canvas. Far more telling are the formal conventions of baroque painting that underscore its every detail, from its diagonal dynamic to its brazen colouring. This work can almost be read as a dictionary of Counter-Reformation precepts. The release of St Peter responds to the Catholic doctrines that reinvigorated European art at the beginning of the seventeenth century. These centred on a call to arms to artists for greater realism and a more directly rendered spirituality. The angel delivering Peter from his bonds is depicted with the naturalism of an artisan going about a chore, while the saint himself is shown in glassy-eyed ecstasy - a favourite condition of baroque painting. Strozzi divides his pigment into areas of flashy impasto and delicate glazing.

It was described in an inventory drawn up between 1634 and 1649 as a view of Laken (a village near Brussels often spelt Laeken), which is how it acquired its present subtitle. The church in the background with an avenue of trees does resemble (in a generic way) the now destroyed church of Our Lady at Laken (recorded in old photographs), which in the seventeenth century housed a famous relic - a girdle of the Virgin - and was a popular place of pilgrimage, especially for women wishing to conceive. The Archdukes attended processions to the church every year and Albert commissioned a new window for the church following its restoration in 1601. Rubens seems to have included the church in the same way that Bruegel does in his Village Festival to suggest that all good things take place with the blessing of the Church and perhaps, in view of the identification of the Archdukes with this particular shrine, under their watchful eye. Rubens also tries to express these good things through a depiction of autumn, when fruits and vegetables are being harvested (the ploughing for next years grain crop is just visible on the hillside to the centre left). The figure group here derives from a Rubens Adoration of the Shepherds (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Marseilles), commissioned in 1616 for the church of St John in Mechelen and delivered in 1619. This echo provides a date for The Farm at Laken, but also strengthens the impression that the figures here are used almost as personifications: the central woman is without shoes (indicating idealisation rather than poverty); she resembles a caryatid, bearing a basket of produce on her head, and reads like an allegory of Plenty. In another context one might assume that the kneeling figure was offering a libation at an altar of Pan or some god of the woodlands. The flock of doves dramatically flying out of the picture towards us also conveys the familiar Rubensian idea of Peace, mother of Plenty. This is one of Rubenss earliest landscapes; his other essays in the genre at this date were hunts, violent scenes of danger set in wild woodlands - like the Boar Hunt of 1616-18 (Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden). It is possible to imagine a pairing of The Farm at Laken and a hunt scene (possibly in Rubenss dining room) to express the contrast between the activities and terrain, which bring meat and vegetarian fare to the table. If so, this painting becomes a sort of allegory of vegetarian fertility and anticipates Rubenss depiction of Pythagoras urging his followers to eat vegetables, also created for his own house. Like most Rubens landscapes, this one has grown in the making, gaining 15 cm to the right, 7 to the left and 13 at the top. It is possible to pick out the original painted area with the naked eye: the top-left corner would just have included the bright cumulus cloud formation, the bottom-right corner the wheelbarrow"}, {"title": "Louis XIV", "artist": "Robert Nanteuil", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Wihp7iVxd7-Oap3P09dgOTL4ovxT4rjhC_0hT_feyRmNYAWSzk7dKnz4NCB8l3e9uNG39xqI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Arion, from 'Game of Mythology' (Jeu de la Mythologie)", "artist": "Stefano della Bella", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9bKyKiE7alHopS7MmcUy54LUWF1P-haOYz2TqqX2yXuaDgDuM_kjxJZePhctIbvTT4O-pw_LE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Figures with Fruit and Game", "artist": "Frans Snyders", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8wGd3QBtf_n-Omt_69101R2oDICN40oytTvbaJhm5RW20CLJ9lBsYePfGHLbHRTAnd9i_mIQ", "desc": "A man with a deer over his shoulder and a woman carrying a basket of fruit on her head"}, {"title": "A Genoese Noblewoman and Her Son", "artist": "Sir Anthony van Dyck", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-Y0DqqZ_C0JoPJNOdo0xQbSrBUbqyAycqn05VvVWNDrwmYRDStW1jap5gsMyfcRym3k9iKYGU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portret van Karel I, koning van Engeland", "artist": "Hollar, Wenceslaus", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-60rWozJbKhf1n_uQAXcKgPfqdiv2zqbvMhG9s9Yra4FS3n745V8YyNUcnSYGy7P2YpHxQOQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Gezicht op Lambeth gezien over de Theems vanuit Whitehall Stairs", "artist": "Hollar, Wenceslaus", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9UkAYQQhVJIR3rG19qo6N141jltPTuY9r8nqemrr9rIdKUuen-J7zqHshtJEfYnzOag6dYHt4", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portret van een man met baard en baret", "artist": "Hollar, Wenceslaus", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM84GcxoHhV1RJguOgXQkSwrTkDbn4EA7MT44-duyHqIZoGTgHIRHz8zBAr1MxAOdkiYnI3NbEE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Full Moon", "artist": "Claude Mellan", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9rBmtqlDA0bvwI-a_KL95ms3cHYOuizJH1HAcHN70bFqcC0cydecyZpMjqZzIxzys3y8owmw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Abraham del Court and his wife Maria de Kaersgieter", "artist": "Bartholomeus van der Helst", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_oN4VG3eNtcL35lngb-2ssgkBHB4pctcwbzyi6bdobDnC61HByXhxEptsC-srRIp9ep2W5TA", "desc": "Bartholomeus van der Helst was one of the most sought-after portraitists of his time.

Murillo clearly surpasses an altar-panel painted by Rubens in Mechelen, which is known to us from drawings and to which Murillos composition owes a great deal, particularly in the naturalness of the pictorial structure with the two life-size figures. A sprinkling of written quotations emphasizes the didactic quality of the picture, which was reduced in height and breadth by about 20 centimetres, which rendered incomplete the proclamation of God the Father.

Impoverished by Spanish rule, the life of the people was embittered by continuous starvation, epidemics, earthquakes, and even the Vesuvius. The hovels of the poor were increasingly crowded, since the scant harvests had forced village folk into the city. Crime flourished in the stale air of the back streets. It was perhaps inevitable that Caravaggios violent art, which grappled with the fear of death, came into its own in Naples, and for decades it set the way for the citys painters.But the school of ruthless naturalism did not reach its peak until a generation later, with Ribera. This Spanish-born master was most in his element when portraying the tortuous deaths of Christian martyrs, with shocking verisimilitude, as in this masterpiece of his darkest period. The apostle Andrew preached the gospel in the East, until Roman governor of Achaea condemned him to follow the founder of his \"superstitious sect\" in death by crucifixion. If anybody, it is Ribera who manages to convince us that for Andrew martyrdom was redemption. His humiliated body is shrivelled by time, his withered skin hangs drily from his frame; and yet there emanates from him a metaphysical power of the soul. Over him tower shadows of a priest and the governor, presaging Goyas oppressive demons.

You can feel disgust or attraction to this somewhat macabre display of flesh and death, while at the same time admiring the formidable technical ability of the artist who painted it. The objects are so realistically depicted that you feel invited to take a seat.The painting is typical of Claesz\u2019 earlier works in the mid-1620s. It is a masterful composition with strong contrasts between the white tablecloth and the pitch-black background, reconciled in the middle by the pinkish-red ham. The straw and smoked herring strewn horizontally across the table create a sense of depth and compositional balance. In this work, Claesz\u2019s ambition appears to have been to explore the form, colour and texture of the different composition elements. One can clearly sense the distinctiveness of the fatty ham, the shiny herring, the warm coals, the matte tin and crusty bread. Claesz often recycled elements from his previous works. The little mustard jar can be found in several of his works, including his still life paintings in the David Collection, Copenhagen and Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Paris.As was customary in the Baroque period, the painting contains several symbols which relate to the ephemeral nature of life, the so-called vanitas symbols. The seemingly arbitrary placement of food on the table leaves the spectator with an impression of a scene where someone has just recently walked away from their meal. Claesz thus manages to incorporate a sort of temporality into a static painting. At the same time, the slowly dying embers in the backdrop constitute a subtle yet unmistakable symbol of the transience of life. Both elements represent the passage of time, something which painters of that era felt was crucial to incorporate into their works"}, {"title": "Winter", "artist": "Wenceslaus Hollar", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-LEUnIk69oe-foHQM4rLrLqeeu44jtB4qwW-eWZYiJ1m7kKjbwUYGjn5r2HeXteRXCiYJ_Lg", "desc": "Increments of time, such as the seasons, were one of the most popular subjects for printed sets.

The Roman historian Pliny had described this renowned sculpture in awed language, as \"a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced.\" Its celebrity prompted many bronze reductions, or smaller-scale copies including this one, made in Florence.

This work depicts an episode from Homer\u2019s Odyssey. We see Circe transforming Odysseus\u2019 companions into animals with her magic wand, while their armour lies empty on the floor. Castiglione may have inherited his penchant for depicting animals from his teacher Scorza.

The title of this work \u2013 View from the Coast of Norway \u2013 dates from its incorporation into the Gulbenkian Collection, and may result from the inspiration the artist found in compositions by Everdingen, who visited Scandinavia. Ruisdael also executed two other similar paintings of rocky coasts (private collection, New York and Nationalmuseum, Stockholm).As in most of his paintings, two thirds of the composition is occupied by the menacing sky, a factor which gives the scene great dramatic force.

Though the painting is relatively small in size, it is apparently not a modello or study for a larger work\u2014the use of a labor-intensive wooden support, along with the painting\u2019s very elaborate finish, indicate that it was an autonomous work. Procaccini\u2019s decision to paint this subject on such a small scale is unconventional\u2014coronation scenes were more often painted as large-scale altarpieces\u2014and necessitated the compression of figures into a tight space. Procaccini\u2019s beginnings were as a sculptor. The precise date of this painting is unknown but it is likely to originate from early in the artist\u2019s career when he made the transition from sculpture to painting. The method of execution is revealing in this regard\u2014the solidity of the figures, the sweeping arcs, and sharp edges that make up the drapery are reminiscent of carved marble. The inclusion of a landscape in the background of this scene is similarly supportive of an early date. The artist\u2019s brother, Carlo Antonio Procaccini (1571 \u2013 1630), was also a painter, and a specialist in Flemish-style landscape painting, and Procaccini collaborated with him at different points in his career.

mortal Tithonus, son of King Laomedon of Troy.

To her horror, as their love affair continues, the once beautiful Tithonus begins to show signs of age. Solimena illustrates a moment later in the narrative, where, preparing to leave for earth to bring about the dawn, Aurora sits on a cloud while an angel crowns her with a wreath of flowers. She looms dominantly over her aged lover, who shields his eyes from the goddess\u2019s brightness. The goddess, pained by Tithonus\u2019 withering appearance and failing body, eventually decided to put him out of his misery and turned him into a grasshopper, to be reminded of him whenever she heard the insect\u2019s song.This large canvas, as well as the Death of Messalina and Venus at the Forge of Vulcan, also in the Getty Museum\u2019s collection, were probably parts of a larger ensemble made for the Procurator, or state attorney, of Venice, Gerolamo Canale.

Believing that they alone survive to perpetuate the human race, the daughters have plied their father with alcohol, to aid their incestuous seduction of him. Each will later bear Lot a son: Moab and Ammon, the founders of tribes often pitted against Israel. Depictions of Lot and his Daughters were popular in seventeenth-century Europe because they provided a righteous context in which to illustrate a social taboo. The subject is often interpreted as a mere pretext for artists to engage with an erotic theme, but the absence of nudity or palpable sensuality in this scene suggests that Gentileschi\u2019s intentions were otherwise.Gentileschi was born in Pisa, but settled in Rome in about 1576. From around 1600, he began to absorb the powerful naturalism of Caravaggio, subsequently becoming one of his closest and most successful followers. However, Gentileschi never gave himself over fully to the uncompromising Caravaggesque style, and maintained traits more characteristic of his native Tuscany; a poetic, refined aesthetic that incorporated a rich blend of highly pitched cool and warm colors.A pendant piece to this work, Dana\u00eb and the Shower of Gold is also in the Getty\u2019s collection. Both paintings were commissioned by the nobleman Giovanni Antonio Sauli in 1621 for his Palazzo in Genoa, along with a third, The Penitent Magdalene, which is today in a private collection"}, {"title": "Landscape with the Good Samaritan", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-iitiXB8iUuYwkVWPrQ3nq88PB9AVPJJcrGtdLg1ArSek5WEccSuktIQKiYyPeT3rlF6S6tWU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portret van Elisabeth Stuart, echtgenote van Frederik V, koningin van Bohemen", "artist": "Bolswert, Bo\u00ebtius Adamsz", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_JetNyUGcFCJsFdbI2sHM9eXAKWiT8yY7GFe6MPkdnC9fs-UyaAlULyzDuhcQ_L5Kri2kPsw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Two Jaguars", "artist": "Jacob Gerritsz.

Stretched out full length with her right flank turned to the viewer and her eyes closed, she seems to be sleeping. Cuyp has painted the smaller cub in the background, meanwhile, in tension, its ears pricked, teeth bared and tail erect. Its direct gaze and glittering eyes mesmerize the viewer.The painter Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp recorded his impressions as naturalistically as possible: the female\u2019s hind legs are extended, one laid over the other, and her right forepaw is bent; while her left foreleg, turned to reveal its underside, seems to be protruding from the picture. Her tongue and canines are visible in her open maw.Cuyp, the leading portraitist in Dordrecht during the first half of the 17th century, owed his renown in large part to his likenesses of children in a landscape. In this piece he has created something relatively rare for Dutch painting, a picture devoted exclusively to animals. Such animal paintings as did exist at the time tended to feature the usual household pets and beasts of labour; a jaguar, on the other hand, is an extremely exotic creature and, as the New World\u2019s lone big cat, constituted a true sensation in Europe at the time. The first examples were probably brought home to the Netherlands of South America from Brazilian expeditions during the Dutch colonization. Perhaps Cuyp saw his subjects in the celebrated menagerie of the governor of The Hague. Cuyp\u2019s immense talent is evident in this painting, in which the depiction of the jaguars\u2019 fur shows the highest mastery. The fine hairs in the animals\u2019 beards, their claws, the underside of a paw, and reflections of light are also rendered with great skill and attention to detail"}, {"title": "Village with Water Mill among Trees", "artist": "Meindert Hobbema", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9tNdtlk9Z8In1Z4fTQAhdNHGd9bXl517rF3KyVnjyKYduIp7heGBx7BCK-aAeNBa5lsekhuGM", "desc": null}, {"title": "De heilige Laurentius", "artist": "Soutman, Pieter Claesz", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9quwIcrpVXiaUs4U48i5cNMjuDXTpaxZGhURBcL8Ag5OYKTYzHf3oRC2NaLHySzyNoyYU7PA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Peasant Attacked by Bees", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9woxy0-cVB1F1r90-SMcTwOdGjMwFOxO-SX5tRpQoSzLm4usqZdthSNAIxyQXlyTpNGLJC9Uw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Twee paarden in een landschap", "artist": "Stoop, Dirk", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM80cMGTiAlCxhO5AlEyPGZFsjdgCInrPxw9Re9UqgGl1sXNR72k9oG0jKrjoNBaD7LtAmZsdw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Oorlogsschepen en een walvis in een zeestorm", "artist": "Hollar, Wenceslaus", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8vqap-2TsD_Wifm2s4O7YE6ngqiSsoX9gg3tC9MTD587cu7Y9u2jbjOPUDIuFd1d6bTgEyrx8", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christ and the Money Changers", "artist": "Mattia Preti", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-ypbu54g_cjjXBoMrS8j49uuopuC0VEZNwCFFGTM70o1O-AeXave2eYgXPajiy9X7-uRqFQe4", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Raising of Lazarus: The Larger Plate", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8UV0_eKCz5-qyR4ZchvvWYABSet-LDGwOSK_uozy1cyYOnUvQ_9GampFaQsrLLhAaYQiejrmU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Oude vrouw in gebed, bekend als \u2018Het gebed zonder end\u2019", "artist": "Maes, Nicolaes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_hitY2syahR9p0l51yGkCM9yT0BqPMbPMnldiAN1jUrExFR8wkps_hYMS-tauIszQ7B2zmiw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hel en vagevuur", "artist": "Callot, Jacques", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9ZCrD9Zu7S39wCMilMl3ktAUtiTp5C9Hei-mhhpb2U6ftRFEwbO_uXauYHpAVr7z4RnwPzzA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Faust (The Scholar in His Study)", "artist": "Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8vW5fnrexQd-LSqCeERkgkfsKyi48CNRw79g4G1tdqM1NCmPYyESBG2-xrfjL2-YHrCXVThlMX", "desc": "For Rembrandt, the printing from a plate was not the final act.

This vessel is a pleyt - a single-mast, sprit- rigged, shallow draught, broad-hulled tub, very similar to a smalschip - adapted to carry large numbers of passengers slowly in calm inland waters. The two pleyten here are made to look as if successive views of the same vessel and show how the sail is lowered as the boat drifts towards the jetty. A drummer announces the arrival of the service and a man fends off with a bargepole. This is a remarkably large scale image of a boat, but there is nothing remarkable about the boat itself or the function it is performing. There are some burghers aboard the pleyt and the rowing-boat but no obvious dignitary; there are many ships in the background but nothing to suggest that this is a review of the Dutch fleet. What we see here is literally a daily occurrence. The drama of presentation here does not just depend upon the isolation of the ferry and its scale. The water-skimming viewpoint means that the hull stands out against the horizon, which glows like a halo as the setting sun catches the mist coming off the sea; it also pushes the mast up into the clouds. These clouds are shaped rather like those in Rembrandts Three Trees (British Museum, London) to suggest the forms of angels or zephyrs surrounding the light of the sky. Hoogstraten later advises artists to Observe the lovely gliding of the clouds, and how their drift and shapes are related to one another, because the eye of the artist must always recognise things by their essence while the common folk see only weird shapes. Peopled clouds were familiar from allegorical prints, like that depicting the Dutch ship of state, produced in 1620 to celebrate the Synod of Dordrecht (1618-19) and showing the Stadholder, Prince Maurice of Orange, at the tiller, surrounded by the Seven Provinces, lit from the sky by a figure of Truth holding the States Bible, while the Pope drowns. This Passage Boat by Cuyp (1620-91) appears too ordinary to be a ship of state, yet the image carries the same visionary enthusiasm. This is probably intended to be a more private allegory of salvation of the type which a spiritual person reads in the ordinary fabric of the world. It would certainly be unlikely for a contemporary viewer to look at this boat without noticing that the mast and sprit-pole make a cross.

Another maid, Charmion, makes final adjustments to Cleopatra\u2019s diadem. Hoet closely followed Plutarchs account in \"Antony\" (The Lives of Noble Grecians and Romans, 44:83) and portrayed the dramatic verbal exchange between Charmion and Caesars messengers immediately following Cleopatras death. In response to their angry demand \"Was this well done of your lady Charmion?,\" she turned and replied \"extremely well, and as became the descendant of so many kings,\" thereby characterizing her mistress suicide as noble self-sacrifice. The soldiers sent by Caesar to confirm Cleopatras death surround the bed, while palace officials, serving women and others rush into the chamber, their stricken faces and animated gestures conveying their agitation.

The Temptation of St Anthony was a theme frequently painted in the Netherlands. This work shows a landscape studded with the ruins of a castle. An old man praying is shown surrounded by a myriad of demons, freely constructed by the artists imagination from elements of fish, birds, human figures and animal bones. The old saint gazes at a woman wearing a white gown. This woman symbolizes profane love, and she tempts the saint by holding out a glass. Close examination reveals that the womans feet are the clawed feet of a bird. Behind the saint to the left can be seen an old woman complete with horns indicating she is a manifestation of evil, pointing at the woman in white.While these various forms of demons bewilder the eyes, it must not be forgotten that Teniers also sought to convey a religious meaning. The lump of stone in front of the saint, reminiscent of an altar, holds symbols of vanitas, such as a skull and hourglass, while it also holds the symbols of salvation, a crucifix and a Bible. These motifs remind the viewer that both the saint and the viewer must choose between the path of salvation or the path of the secular world. Teniers frequently painted this subject and basically these works present a re-use of the main motifs. Compared to the works of his mature period during the 1640s when he depicted the scene in a cave, this work and his other later period works put more emphaisis on the depictoin of the landscape.

This small and exquisite painting, executed on copper, captures the very best qualities of Van Hulsdoncks work. Set atop a plain wooden table, a beautifully articulated Wan-Li bowl is filled with wild strawberries and adorned by a single carnation, dramatically silhouetted against a dark background. This unexpected element adds tension to the visually simple yet luscious composition. The cherries, red and white currants, and random water droplets arrayed on the table form a pattern of circles that echo the round forms of the strawberries and the bowl. The droplets reinforce the still lifes sense of fleeting freshness, and the transience of the moment is heightened by the presence of the delicate butterfly that has just alighted on a leaf and by the fly feasting on a berry.

He resented almost all his commissions being for portraits, but it was in this genre, which leaves least space for creativity and is thus held in disdain by critics, that he created his greatest works. The focus of Van Dycks portraits is not the face, which is always bathed in a haze of melancholy; that is a mask belonging to the role assigned on the stage of society, worn with obedience, rather than the true mirror of the soul. Far livelier and more revealing are the hands: they divulge the character, and tell tales about the heroes.

It must, however, have been painted after 1679, since it was in that year that the Barberini Faun was restored, which is now in the Glyptothek in Munich , and as Oreste Ferrari notes in the monograph on the artist  (first published in 1966) this was the model for the figure of Bacchus. The composition is interesting since the artist has arranged shepherds and satyrs, cupids and nymphs around the god who is lying sprawled out asleep, having downed too much wine, while all kinds of animals including a tiger on a leash look on. This seeming confusion is rendered harmonious by the landscape depicted at sunset, whose tonal quality is reminiscent of Venetian painting.

This is firmly in keeping with Flemish tradition, which, unlike the Netherlandish one, almost always enhanced landscapes with Christian or mythological narratives. On a forest path slightly ascending from the centre to the right, four figures appear: two elderly people, arduously propped up on walking sticks and accompanied by two gods, have escaped the storm still raging at the centre of the painting. They are Philemon and Baucis. Shortly before the storm, they were the only ones to give shelter, food and drink to the gods, who were travelling through the land disguised as weary travellers. The punishment for the hard-heartedness of the other people was swift to follow \u2013 Jupiter and Mercury showed only this married couple the way to the safety of a hill in time (Ovid, Metamorphoses 8:620\u2013720). In the foreground the effects of the forces of nature are drastically depicted: helplessly, an ox lies trapped in a broken tree above the torrential floods; on the left, near the rainbow, the corpses of a mother and her child havebeen washed ashore; above them a man fortunate enough to have escaped clings to a tree that is still standing. The present Landscape with Philemon and Baucis was probably painted entirely by Rubens himself, without the help of his workshop. Like most of his landscapes it was not a commissioned piece.

Like Hals, she painted with an assured, spontaneous touch, and she chose the same  themes: portraits, children playing, musicians, and figures dancing and drinking. Grinning broadly, a man holds up a tankard. He is Pekelharing, a stage character who cropped up in the farces of the time. His name means \u2018salt herring\u2019, a Dutch speciality that causes a raging thirst, and he was a true drunkard. Pekelharing was often featured in paintings; he is to be found, for instance, in a work by Frans Hals, also painted around 1629. Judith Leyster\u2019s Pekelharing was guilty not just of drinking, but  of smoking too.

This allowed him to compose a bouquet of flowers that in real life do not bloom at the same time"}, {"title": "Temptations of Saint Jerome", "artist": "Oil on canvas", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Av8YUmHOAcmnxDg2JHoz1k_jy1DidIePOCsXXyddRKRzZH0H5XLc8oDx03eoJ_pzofavqZg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Oude man de blik naar beneden gericht: driekwart, naar rechts", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8stTdnLzHk98xbVlnAGoHgl8HbXEiiNXDqAtDmMfzSUmW6fwderO01TGT8hwlBAyo-Ehb1Mm8", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hieronymus in gebed: plaat met gebogen bovenrand", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_J_o3qCSeouucPuYiziNCkZKapIs0Q4vZA2HBqFDEti7u5tk6uQR_l41eNlUW8G5j_o_Kmrew", "desc": null}, {"title": "L'Arquebusade (The Firing Squad)", "artist": "Jacques  Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8gQHfZDvF_JTk1ZT113KMs3blRy64qVAIL5B3lDIAIp1PGLKYFY4NLhkn2rNlURA_IDYQjPeM", "desc": null}, {"title": "Madonna with the Child and Saint Francis", "artist": "Antonio Carracci", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9kOs-bklwvgca4RsH3qt1hYi0ezqiy03BMMUaD0oZMGwc3pSEG7sqB7JYA69DeQL0SxfpAIHdv", "desc": null}, {"title": "Fruit and a Glass of Wine", "artist": "Willem van Aelst", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-cMCY38uO3DuKSSd0VFMnBhXeSVmwy8GNTS1V3NOo1JerlYKaF8Wqq1_LZ0G_5pKITPpJSMQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Wooded Landscape with Waterfall", "artist": "Jacob van Ruisdael", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-XDp1QGSmZ1C_zXG_AS6WZ3URQGn9g8yxFhLp6uRlAw8rZgdqawtkdBRc9d5hTe8PsYuHi", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Large Miseries of War:  Title Page", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8_13X9xfDvymWk5nz_OI0vklEQ759VQgS8SENVQmTmGwMpSnbZcteEMU89dbELE0yyMgA2", "desc": null}, {"title": "L'Homme Masqu\u00e9 aux Jambes Torses (The Masked Man with Crooked Legs), from Varie Figure Gobbi, suite appel\u00e9e aussi Les Bossus, Les Pygm\u00e9es, Les Nains Grotesques (Various Hunchbacked Figures, The Hunchbacks, The Pygmes, The Grotesque Dwarfs)", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-mCxWMOkJKNQfcPuZvVo5JTZVWDffpT-RWixHMSbA-_iR2ekBFp9syk_4ObZAxXchWBC03OQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of Cornelis Claesz.

In Borromeo\u2019s philosophical-theological view, these paintings went well beyond their secular significance and acquired a profound religious value, since Nature was the book written by God, so that man could rise up from Creation to its Creator. Unfortunately, only two of the four works \u2013 the Allegory of Fire and the Allegory of Water \u2013 are now in the Ambrosiana, because much of the Pinacoteca\u2019s assets were taken to France after being plundered under Napoleon. The Allegory of Earth and the Allegory of Air are now in the Louvre, from which they have never been returned, in spite of the 1815 agreements.The painting is remarkable for the richness of its natural landscape, it was sent by Brueghel to Cardinal Federico in 1614 and was the third in the series"}, {"title": "Young Woman Going to Bed", "artist": "Jacob Van Loo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8R1t4fVsxYGz1svrSzD26cAEmNCB0z_FL4SuaZH6Cr1X0Btvq4Vpm3pXAkNh6kScUrIMZl", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Jerome reading", "artist": "Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM80Jx4GsZHMlYe5-YGTVldeFdAgMCcJCyf01TO9yrS5IKA17xmf7Qc14P7Pxy2r9Yu5CnLh0Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "Skull in profile to right", "artist": "Wenceslaus Hollar", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9iITdhbIJjo_bA0vO50bZZTJXVHDAk6NPEy_0AMFcFjc_YC6G6sriUcnSZhUcfGkR8mA-sFuE", "desc": null}, {"title": "St. Dominic and the Devil", "artist": "oil paintings", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-xUfDdcXUe0CzI8YZYIDUuqfr1iyH0AYd6mmy7pQKIHYjJQ74SQSCH1l4MrxNMGd1sB087Mdk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Harbour Scene at Sunset, 1639", "artist": "Claude Gell\u00e9e", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-nCBBSOYssmBR6Ua_jg1s9X7C8pFdaTVOsIyF6CBg-JW4pbwCDB0eeHrHeuKU9eIFbZgRuBxU", "desc": "Claude Gell\u00e9e (1602-1682) is famous for his landscape paintings.

He had been trained in Abraham Bloemaert\u2019s large studio in Utrecht, and had familiarised himself with the style of Florentine and Venetian Mannerism there. But he detached himself from Mannerism as current in his homeland under the influence of Italian Renaissance art. Large-scale form, composition, drawing and contrasting light and shade now became fundamental. Our picture is the earliest known commission executed by Honthorst in Rome. It was painted in 1616/18 for art connoisseur and collector Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, a promoter of modern admiration of Caravaggio. In this composition Honthorst reduced the account in the Acts of the Apostles (12, 6-7) simply to the words \u201cGet up quickly\u201d, with which the angel asked the astonished prisoner Peter to leave the gaol from the door that had burst open. The warriors and prison guards are left out, as are the chains that were said to have fallen from the prisoner\u2019s hands. All the characteristics of Caravaggio\u2019s style come into play in the concentration on Peter and the angel, their violent physical and spiritual movement, which is effectively carried by the magnifi cent handling of light and shade, the powerful plasticity of the design and the warmth of the colouring. They give the scene a magical sense of drama. Honthorst\u2019s angel\u2019s gesture is clearly borrowed directly from Caravaggio\u2019s Calling of St. Matthew in the church of San Luigi Francesi in Rome. This early pictorial invention by Honthorst seems to have been generally hailed as a masterpiece, and thus recurs in numerous replicas and copies. A drawing in the Kupferstichkabinett in Dresden used to be seen as a preliminary drawing by the artist for the Berlin painting, but it is now attributed to Abraham Bloemaert"}, {"title": "Simeon's Song of Praise", "artist": "Oil", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_H3XI0ev-K9Lgz4_LCvXCHbVALxGmSkrnJLndYKOLn3Vh-l_GxxN2PBVwWy6YeSyPVSD7eeP8", "desc": "Joseph and Mary are in the temple to dedicate their newborn baby Jesus to God, where the child is recognised by Simeon as the long-awaited Messiah.

Murillos masterpiece enjoys their admiration not merely for its captivating, gentle charm, but also because it would hardly be possible to express more perfectly the mission of the institution. The vision of Jesus distributing bread reminds us of the Christians duty to care for those who fall by the wayside, a duty that originates with Christ himself. Yet it affirms this with a self-evident naturalness free of any didactic overtones. The viewers thus experience the not as a chore, but as an inner spiritual compulsion which they willingly obey.It was precisely this intimate immediacy and warm empathy which was the secret of Murillos popularity, which in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries rivalled Raphaels. Perhaps today the Spanish geniuss sentimental mood seems too cloying, but it never errs into kitsch: the subject of its deep humanism is not some wistful ideal, but an ordinary man of flesh and blood. Though the mood is lofty, within the figures flickers the ghost of Caravaggios plebeian characters. One former critic characterized his art as \"noble naturalism\". The dignity of the characters derives primarily from sincere humility, and it is this virtue that characterizes the gesture of the donor of Jesus distributing Bread, Canon Justino de Neve, who had his portrait placed among the needy pleading for charity."}, {"title": "The Marriage of the Virgin", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8RLS3TnlaKNuQmFdYnx41_-lecRUSJ40gZCUD13U504p_c6lY5_qGVf2lApmDzfHI5kxJhBqE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Madonna and Child, Saint John the Baptist and Pope Stephen", "artist": "Pietro da Cortona", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-MMEdQSpXTO8amLVxEgXxRgNnJBmh8NQO_SFp8sr0PFOToKRZ72AtyR1Xn7hnstCF4iUfv9r0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Jesus and the Pharisees from The New Testament", "artist": "Etching", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-peTaP6nObI1T-zviPTJenvhntZHOW7Z6qsNY3NVQa1IEFD_SCRhCPiJdlYi0ywaQJ64aXIw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Meeting of the Officers and Sergeants of the St Adrian Civic Guard (the Calivermen)", "artist": "Frans Hals", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-oAa9o9zWDzTjj_3NnejEYuA_UVCHidK4qg8FD8JG8V9Xd-aslVtTMvbxpwuPSQCm2RK00SGCR", "desc": "Officers and sergeants of the Calivermen meeting outdoors.

(lit. daughter of Andries) Hessix, wife of Michiel Jansz. van Middelhoven, a pastor from the city of Voorschoten, near Leiden, who also sat for Frans Hals for a painting whose current location is unknown. Both works were part of a pair and are thought to have been produced to celebrate the 40th anniversary of his wedding in 1586.This composition came to be used as a formula for similar portraits executed later on, as it was the painters first representation of a natural-sized female figure in sitting position. The work relates to a phase in which Frans Hals style still reveals a rigorous attention to the drawing, something the painter later abandoned when he adopted a more spontaneous brush style.

Instead of the Italianate golden-age idylls, to the Haarlem masters it was the here-and-now that mattered, and they painted everyday Dutch flatlands: dunes, canals, village streets, and the sea. These had hitherto been considered unworthy as subjects for a picture, but now seemed appropriate for conveying the new idea of the nation. And to make the new relationship clear, the viewpoint was brought down from on high to the ground. Now the sky dominated the picture, and the moist air cast a veil over the landscape. The Haarlem landscapists are admired chiefly for their masterful suggestion of this humid atmosphere. Each artist was able to create a different mood. Of the two greatest masters it is said that in Jan van Goyens works it always seems that rain is in the offing, while in Salomon van Ruysdaels we sense a fresh breeze has just dispersed the shower. In After the Rain, known by this title since the nineteenth century, one can almost smell the refreshing scent as the ground breathes after the storm. The crisp, crystal-clear outlines suggest that for a moment the mist has risen. The cool tones of colour create a chill mood, though a strip of the dune is bathed in golden radiance by the sun breaking through the clouds. In the house at the edge of the village the tired travellers find solace at last"}, {"title": "Een geleerde in zijn werkkamer", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9anQFxYcipo4pAwNT0GqVgY-GkHvrQAdHEQ-MzQsbKkSi8apmnosUNBYea9_BFm97SD5IdC5s", "desc": null}, {"title": "Het welkomsttoneel; intocht van Ferdinand te Antwerpen in 1635 (nr. 6) (rechterhelft)", "artist": "Thulden, Theodoor van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_0dXtxYrFPIkWZQw_xtGmq4KAzJ-nPY_nu2EUc4hTifZ88UF7fIsmTe_E5YkKiYicFpKSc8w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Plato en Aristoteles", "artist": "Vaillant, Wallerant", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8YlpRIAp6w-2SVWS3P2hqSs_uesNiaWLQLS7Fx6ey3Y4TU7UMzkeRh9MeIv6cZZvP1gO47rTig", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Triumph of Galatea", "artist": "Bernardo Cavallino", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_S5cWHQADGo948FweVIgE4ZGYW90pLxK2kSODK6G8aENPI6fzHzH61yIbsa4Pyqr9yTtj9j03P", "desc": null}, {"title": "Civis Coloniensis Filia", "artist": "Hollar, Wenceslaus", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9OqVLDzgvpjWh6biwu2UYVEKqyzyEBCHcfiNjLH1Io7sMPd7buv5LHSqb1ZKh4mHHt53LH0k0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ho Nee Yeath Taw No Row, King of the Generethgarick", "artist": "John Verelst", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9qZQcj2MLNAau003ymJ8TNdGHkUBT336OnxA00D-w1nyrswDagjdiJO6I2soNs4KnDAjhztmw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Old Lacemaker", "artist": "oil", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_rR19wfaoOAyxBqGbi1e7BJB3MtBzm0c5weoHd-MgC1IO6mPTOwXK2WUjBp2Wpx0Oes6m3DQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "L'origine della Via Lattea", "artist": "Rubens, Peter Paul", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9nGld3DnvBetzgFv5gM4S-Nm3WQIJ75nVF9VtvROCFzILp61DRHjzB_xyNldLvoRnwLdm_nng", "desc": null}, {"title": "Views of London:  Whitehall from the River", "artist": "Wenceslaus Hollar", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8O2W7_0pXgJm3vuIE7TKJro5yJYNEZECmafBqWgRHlqBUZbDNm9_8E3iMb7IlFAFGrkfqp", "desc": null}, {"title": "Turbaned Soldier on Horseback", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8pUPR0nTK6G1w9ki-E7NGWTzBnsGqG_isKbreQ6QlR7yGJ1t-x-ze23Gp_lOueMa8OYPp_7w", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Dam and Damrak, Amsterdam", "artist": "Jan van der Heyden", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM87_QSd2eKaYFz8MTBlFeK0UUD6FjSqNsbw6rbaotgYfAnfA_S_eTfkbI7Xwavro7bFxo6nbP0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christ Preaching ('La Petite Tombe')", "artist": "Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-otfmBoqa_h057cvPQQLdv8ogEttBByvojXjlBjHf-70fS7ReC8GDgwVxZPpeXr4I8JpmaEQ", "desc": "Rembrandt returned to the subject of Christ preaching with this more tightly composed work.

This centaur, half man, half horse, was, in classical mythology, a famous teacher to various heroes and gods.

He also gave lessons in horse-riding and medicine, which is symbolised by the god Aesculapius, who is depicted on the left as a hermit. This is the second in a series of eight oil sketches by Rubens, based on the life of the Greek hero Achilles. Rubens designed four series of tapestries, and all four were executed. That was an expensive and time-consuming procedure in which oil sketches like these were just the first step. They were followed by larger painted models, which preceded full-size cartoons for the weaver which were ten times the size of the initial sketches and were typically painted by assistants. It is hard to imagine that a project of that kind could be undertaken without a patron, but in three of the four cases we do not know who this was. The last series was made around 1630, and all eight of sketches have survived. Seven are in Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. They chronicle the life of the Greek hero Achilles from his baptism in the Stynx, one of the legendary rivers of the underworld. That baptism would have made him immortal if his mother had not held him by the heel while immersing him.

Following the appointment of Albert and his wife Isabella (a daughter of the Spanish King Philip II) as sovereign regents of the Spanish Netherlands, he moved the headquarters of the brotherhood to Brussels in 1603. This explains why a saint seldom revered in Flanders found his way into one of the most significant altarpieces of Rubens\u2019s late period. The infanta commissioned the work in Albert\u2019s memory in 1630, nine years after his death. According to legend, while walking through his church one day, the Spanish monk (605\u2013667; 657 archbishop of Toledo) was surprised by a blazing light and the vision of the Virgin Mary on a throne, accompanied by two female saints. While his companions took flight, he approached the venerated saint and was presented with a precious chasuble she had made herself. The donors appear on the wings of the altar in the company of their patron saints. Rubens had not used the form of the triptych since 1618. Why the painter and client chose this antiquated type more than a decade later remains unclear. Perhaps the depiction of the donor and her (by then deceased) husband to the right and left of the central panel was an attempt to circumvent an order issued in 1608, which \u2013 although not always obeyed \u2013 forbade the use of portraits of living people in the central altar panel. The wings, however, are so closely tied to the centre panel with regards to composition that the physical division of the three sections by the frame is of hardly any consequence: the red of the velvet draped over the two prie-dieux returns in the garment of the Virgin Mary, while the yellow-gold colour of the regents\u2019 attire is reflected in the niche behind the throne.

The Calling of Saint Matthew, painted by Caravaggio in 1599\u20131600 for the  Contarelli Chapel in the Church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, inspired three of ter Brugghen\u2019s compositions. The work in Le Havre, undoubtedly painted around 1620, borrows from the Italian master the motif of Christ calling Levi, the tax collector who becomes Saint Matthew, to abandon everything and join the apostles. The gesture of Christ, the surprise of Matthew, the postures of his plebeian-looking companions and the contrasted lighting of the scene call to mind Caravaggios Roman model. The dense composition, framed around the figures, the artists interest in anecdotal details and the hardy features of the models nevertheless betray his attachment to traditional northern formulae.Painted in 1621, another Calling of Saint Matthew, at the museum in Utrecht, shows the rapid evolution of ter Brugghens work towards a stronger and yet more personal Caravaggism, with a monumental and elaborate style that justifies the admiration he received from his contemporaries, Rubens in particular, and his position as leader of the Utrecht Caravaggisti"}, {"title": "Bacchus verandert zijn ontvoerders in dolfijnen", "artist": "Matham, Jacob", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8hIoAnOu1LNO_9ftjihJmEYRcXt9M_vRfakR4pKsZilRrr8A2IxXOlAIdXKpQVY-P5HRf-oXOp", "desc": null}, {"title": "Head of an old man with a pronounced chin, short cropped hair and gaping mouth showing teeth in profile to left", "artist": "Wenceslaus Hollar", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-zPMNSb9BEsA0k9JerZYUQsagwgcf014-JFcUwp1IRrpeINgmqfzQqetw196bC5VGPYtqAYA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Jongen in een atelier", "artist": "Vaillant, Wallerant", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-_EfRee2G6J8-FLzddYoMLn4HXVVRZbHoDUCriKxW74-rqZTuQ_BCS18VTCl0O7xuTsmiua21W", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Card Party", "artist": "Caspar Netscher", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8UVbVUq2MhIywngIpOtwChfzjtU-KeTH09dL-JtbYdh2MxT1q0MAfCkUlQz80LEAVfeBVWUO1H", "desc": null}, {"title": "Rustende jagers", "artist": "Stoop, Dirk", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9JFTQ_xSsZWaNYAvrXI3f9UVJo_cTmvcSLPKZFdOyTNRaLniCdXkqp3Bm466YrZDwLJ_NpmTU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Two Horse Heads", "artist": "Stefano Della Bella", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9xFVA3r-Hb2V-YOBfFY7Nn5JaGaIwWmlIAFe20uk7ji4uO1_MvfnQcFsENgtk6BBoXag5Ii92Y", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of William Byrd II", "artist": "Sir Godfrey Kneller", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM__9RpZNikZKM4UfpjghU3Hol_yAPIqSmrLa6CIJwDSmTv5dGUYLZxhdW_AVyy5Mbxvzu2LsDE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Jacob's dream", "artist": "Francesco Guarino", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9rFyvNg_7WGexjqDUwgvxhNiGomiEDr5dZ8mYyCxHnvlU-XAVyIqSekKFJRhNJtKlA2IdFekh9", "desc": "This painting, which entered the Academy\u2019s collections as part of the Fabio Rosa bequest, was originally known as \u201ca painting from the Neapolitan school\u201d but has recently been definitively attributed to Francesco Guarino.

The Adoration of the Magi, a scene so often depicted, has rarely been treated with such humanity and sumptuousness. Mary and Joseph have taken refuge in a cave laid out as a stable, with a wood and brick shed in the background. The humble straw-lined cradle contrasts with the magnificence of the fluted cup filled with gold coins and the dazzling costumes of the visitors from afar: rich cloaks garnished with fur, a shining gold tunic, brocades and damask. Positioned on the same oblique line, the kings probably represent the three ages of life. Beside them, servants present royal offerings. In the background, soldiers and onlookers packed into too small a space form a group expressing a variety of feelings. A very young boy, lost in shadow amid the crowd, carries the myrrh and looks at us. With its vivid colors, the effects of the materials, and a dense composition based on diagonals and arabesques linking characters and planes, this work by Rubens is inspired by the Baroque. The Flemish artist portrayed this subject many times. This picture, dated about 1617\u20131618, was probably intended for a private collection because its horizontal format makes it hard to imagine it being designed to adorn an altar.

Hercules was traveling across northern Libya when he encountered the giant Antaeus, who challenged him to a fight to the death. Again and again, Hercules would throw the giant to the ground, but the giant would get back up. As the son of Gaia, goddess of the Earth, Antaeus gained the strength of a god whenever he touched the ground. Hercules noticed this just as he was about to be defeated. Then, when Anteus was in the air, where he was weaker, he broke his neck and killed him. This painting portrays the moment when he is holding the giant up so he cannot touch the ground. The muscle tension of both subjects and the expression on the giants face lend the scene a great deal of realism.

this work, his earliest known monotype. In a perfect match of medium and message, Castiglione, the Genoese artist credited with inventing the technique, used this new method to portray the central act of Genesis: the creation of man. He produced this electrifying image by subtracting the design from the inked surface of a copperplate with a blunt instrument, such as a stick or paintbrush handle, and then printing directly on a sheet of paper. Broad, angular strokes of white depict God emerging from a cloud, while thin, fluid lines extract the languid body of Adam from velvety blackness. Castiglione\u2019s monotypes employ both this dark-ground technique, which naturally lends itself to dramatic and mysterious imagery, and the light-ground manner, in which the design is drawn in ink directly on a clean plate. Both processes yield only one fine impression. It was not until the nineteenth century that such versatile artists as Edgar Degas explored the monotype\u2019s full potential"}, {"title": "La Mort \u00e0 cheval", "artist": "Stefano Della Bella", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM93-hGF4cTMdWwmqYqGFTPPsWj2jLWANYfLklak2SKTZ5YuEZB23buLeKdd7BehXtAXqd_kWy8", "desc": null}, {"title": "Return of the Prodigal Son", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8u3CPluuQFxAgqmvQ_iD6OO1fTI2WF8glLvJEsigSH_WA3AU7EUjNw8lpmWIPmIEACL7aL", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christus aan het volk getoond (Ecce Homo)", "artist": "Rijn, Rembrandt van", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8MaZIK65mdkZL5TSZX0G7afAtkquRIjXCS4ZXsIcSE9Re2b-4DIfjLRqDPPg7oWCoLfyzxdg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Rocky landscape with ruins, forming the profile of a man's face", "artist": "Herman Saftleven", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9lqeeHxXu-XU1uiPxkk6KCyaNZUbp0kbBcYnrGrAtl2eoXsvfFkx_pLxuQnMyKlyJIF8zX2w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Self-Portrait with Plumed Cap and Lowered Sabre", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8lI2TEKLBRHEDQiemBPhpW5BxJhX8zBhzPUj4Rw7G1rVjT-MnUQCsGOnGNaflLgz6bvCv0rZ0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Moorish Cavalier", "artist": "Stefano Della Bella", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_3N8FflPRUKRyNQmpCcjfLuwCj6OyAEs1XcoCPeCNIj48EtzbNhl9owOx-DVI3A5ImBjkIjw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Beggar with Dog", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-NNIL57nQXngUG5IZ8csWGAJe3MokjvjfMfVL95qul1K_k-K-nmNm77iy0LbfE9fPu6VFCKSA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Cephalus and Procris", "artist": "Johann Michael Rottmayr", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-EPtwAbMRLv7FxrA2ph9QHqV4GkiAxLwPLeUVsz8-eb40fazXWoMv-XEDO7uMA5f5v8qhB4Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Three Trees", "artist": "Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM895aAtYKgs1uq2mpKvIJhCny3CR8ADkUhZqtFrH-kcn8EKWrpno12XywypsjNu8mY145aBrA", "desc": "The view has been identified as taken near the Diemerdijk, in the immediate vicinity of Amsterdam.

Its companion, in the Mus\u00e9e Royal des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, depicts Nicolaes van Bembeeck (1596 - 1661), a wool merchant who had married Agatha Bas (1611-58) in 1638. It is also signed and dated 1641. The couple lived in the Sint Anthoniesbreestraat, where Rembrandt himself lived from 1631; they were almost certainly known to the artist. Rembrandt introduced a new compositional device in this painting: the figure is posed within a painted ebony frame which blurs the boundaries between the imaginary space within the composition and the real world outside. The sense of direct contact with the sitter is achieved partly through the striking gesture of the hand resting against the frame and partly by showing the fan protruding over the edge towards the viewers space. An earlier reduction in the size of the canvas has considerably reduced this illusionistic effect. The different levels of finish in the painting are particularly striking. For instance, Rembrandt portrays the fine hairs at the edge of the hairline through curling lines incised into the paint with the end of the brush, and in contrast to such direct handling the depiction of Agatha Bass skin and eyes is remarkably subtle and delicate. There are five paintings by Rembrandt in the Royal Collection, the earliest of which, The Artists Mother(?), was presented to Charles I before 1633, and was thus one of the first works by Rembrandt to reach England. Of the three Rembrandts collected by George IV, The Shipbuilder and his Wife, purchased for 5,000 guineas in 1811, was perhaps his most famous single acquisition.

aimed only to capture the lively spirit of his peasant subjects daily activities. He animated this scene with lively penwork but also exploited the potential of watercolor. His thin, translucent washes allowed the white of the paper to show through. In brilliant colors, they suffuse the whole street with luminous, airy sunlight. The vivid yet delicate pastel hues give the earthy subject matter an air of refinement that would have appealed to contemporary collectors.  Dutch taste for such finished drawings grew throughout the 1600s.

To the left, travelers apprehensively pause to watch a magician conjure terrifying apparitions. Since the Middle Ages, necromancy, the act of communing with the dead, was associated with male sorcerers. In Rosas painting, the wizened necromancer who stands tall and resolute directly below a classical column is reminiscent of Moses, a predecessor to Renaissance depictions of sorcerers. Rosas learned magicians not only invoke associations with philosophers and intellects, but they would have also referred to the artist himself and the intellectual elite with whom he associated in Florence.

In exchange for his beloved, he took Briseis, the beloved of Achilles, in her place. This scene is the fourth in a series of eight oil sketches. In this depiction of the episode, the enraged Achilles is shown drawing his sword while being restrained by his hair by Minerva. Agamemnon is rising from his throne and is being restrained by his arm by the wise Nestor. After this episode, Achilles refused to take any further part in the war against Troy. Only after the death of his friend Patroclus did Achilles become reconciled with Agamemnon and return to the Greek army. This oil sketch is the fourth in a series of eight oil sketches which Rubens made about the life of Achilles in preparation for a series of tapestries. Rubens designed four series of tapestries, and all four were executed. That was an expensive and time-consuming procedure in which oil sketches like these were just the first step. They were followed by larger painted models, which preceded full-size cartoons for the weaver which were ten times the size of the initial sketches and were typically painted by assistants. It is hard to imagine that a project of that kind could be undertaken without a patron, but in three of the four cases we do not know who this was. The last series was made around 1630, and all eight of sketches have survived. Seven are in Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. They chronicle the life of the Greek hero Achilles from his baptism in the Stynx, one of the legendary rivers of the underworld. That baptism would have made him immortal if his mother had not held him by the heel while immersing him.

The painting in the Brukenthal Art Gallery also carries a number of symbolic features. The positioning of the man, between the vines, with one tendril pointing at him and the group of objects on the window sill, brings to mind that vine is generally a symbol of life and Christian living, whereas in 17th century Dutch painting, scenes containing characters drinking wine usually carry a connotation of debauchery. One is tempted to see here a pictorial metaphor of the human condition, alternating between the call of spiritual life and the temptation to sample the new forms of pleasure (shells, in the Dutch painting of the epoch, symbolized the new geographic discoveries, with their exotic lure and attending riches, but they were also a symbol of lust).

Van Dyck, however, applied his paint with wide, uneven brushstrokes. He would render an arm or a leg with just a few self-assured dashes of paint, as if he were making an oil sketch. Jerome\u2019s deeply lined, red face, which forms a strong contrast to his pale body, suggests that Van Dyck was working from a model. Jerome appears in several of his paintings from around 1615-1618. One of the four Church Fathers, Jerome was an erudite scholar, renowned for his Latin translation of the Bible. The angel proffering a quill signifies that his writings were the fruits of divine inspiration.

It does in fact display different influences. Elements of early 17th-century painting from the region of Liguria, as exemplified by the blond angel to the right of St Francis, are combined with references both to Flemish art, in the face of the other angel and the rich handling of colour in general, and to Caravaggio, in the saint\u2019s ecstatic expression. Taken all together, this evidence points unquestionably to the hand of Pietro Novelli, also known as Il Monrealese, the leading Sicilian painter of the 17th century. The influences to which Novelli was exposed during his years of training in Palermo included the frescoes by painters from Liguria in the Oratory of Santo Stefano Protomartire, Caravaggio\u2019s Adoration of the Shepherds, and above all Van Dyck, who was in the city in 1624 and produced the Madonna of the Rosary altarpiece a few years later for the Oratory of San Domenico, whose confraternity Novelli joined in 1630. An echo of this can be discerned in the vigorous handling of light and in the profile of the angel, which is reminiscent of the graceful female saint in the foreground of Van Dyck\u2019s great canvas. Support for this attribution is also provided by comparison with the depiction of David with the head of Goliath in the Getty Museum in Malibu, where extraordinary similarities can be seen both in the gesture of the left hand of the male figures, which are practically identical, and in the severed head of Goliath, which is almost a mirror image of Saint Francis. Further evidence comes from the painting of the Resurrection in the Prado, where the angel on the left reappears in different forms. Like the painting in the Getty Museum, this is an early work produced before 1630, when the artist probably made a trip to Rome and Naples, after which his painting displayed a greater degree of naturalism deriving from acquaintance with the work of Jusepe de Ribera, also known as Lo Spagnoletto"}, {"title": "Cap.

Jh. - 420 n. Chr.) geh\u00f6rt zu den vier bedeutenden Kirchenv\u00e4tern. Sein wichtigstes Werk war eine Bibel\u00fcbersetzung aus dem Griechischen in die lateinische Sprache. In der Malerei wird er traditionell in zwei Darstellungstypen wiedergegeben: Als Gelehrter in der Studierstube und als Eremit vor Landschaftshintergrund. Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) zeigt einen kraftvollen Kirchenvater, der intensiv an der Bibel\u00fcbersetzung arbeitet. Stilllebenartige B\u00fccherarrangements weisen auf seine zahlreichen Schriften hin, die Sanduhr auf den Vanitasgedanken und der Kardinalshut auf die Berufung des Kirchenvaters. Vermutlich w\u00e4hlte Rubens den kr\u00e4ftigen Hieronymus-Typus anstelle eines ausgezehrten alten Eremiten, um ihn als k\u00e4mpferischen und engagierten Gelehrten des Christentums zu charakterisieren. Das Gem\u00e4lde entstand kurz nach Rubens Italienaufenthalt (1600-1608). Die dort angefertigten Skizzen nach Werken der Antike und der italienischen Renaissance beeinflussten seine sp\u00e4teren Arbeiten deutlich. So erkennt man beim heiligen Hieronymus Motive aus Werken Michelangelos, die Rubens in der Sixtinischen Kapelle in Rom gesehen hatte. Auch ist der Oberk\u00f6rper des Kirchenvaters in Analogie zur ber\u00fchmten antiken Statue des Herkules Farnese gestaltet. Erst 1815 wurde das Gem\u00e4lde vom Inspektor der Bildergalerie, Gottlieb Puhlmann, in die Galerie aufgenommen. Es diente als Ersatz f\u00fcr ein Gem\u00e4lde, das durch die napoleonischen Truppen nach Paris gef\u00fchrt worden war und auch nach den Befreiungskriegen nicht zur\u00fcckkehrte. Rubens Autorschaft war im Laufe der Jahrhunderte zeitweilig in Vergessenheit geraten. Zugeschrieben wurde das Bild an Abraham van Diepenbeeck, sp\u00e4ter an Gaspar de Crayers und Abraham Janssens. Erst 1953 konnte die Zuschreibung an Rubens wieder best\u00e4tigt werden.

The narrowed eyes of the character on the left side are a result of the pitiless glare of the sun, the blouse, pulled down to reveal the breasts and the heat-struck face of the character in the foreground are signs of the stifling summer heat, while the distress in the eyes of the central character reflects the charged atmosphere, preceding the storm. The women are caught in motion, their features, as well of those of the babe in arms, reveal ancestral strength and a great capacity for endurance, in spite of their congestion and the harrowing physical effort. Their elementary strength is mirrored by the forces of nature: the billowing cloud formations in the background and the rising wind, suggested by the way one of the women holds on to her straw hat. In his painting The Summer, Jordaens succeeds admirably in juxtaposing the full glare of a torrid summer day (radiating from left) and the menacing darkening of the sky preceding the storm (to the right).

According to this still hotly disputed thesis, Dutch art - unlike the Italian tradition, which always told stories - basically strove to observe and describe objects, and ultimately to know the world through experience; one might say this approach was of scientific nature, rather than literary. Whatever ones view of such a generalization, one thing is certain: a memorial statue to such an artistic attitude could be modelled on Saenredam. He developed a complex working method based on mechanical calculations so that he could depict with documentary fidelity the Protestant churches and town-hall chambers which symbolized the ideals of the young Dutch nation. His paintings were created through long months of painstaking work, and thus are extremely rare precious, with no more than sixty of them known. But art is never purely documentation, and sure enough not even Saenredam was always perfectly faithful to what he saw. Due to the carefully chosen viewpoints and light conditions, the spaces often appear (as in the present painting) lighter, airier, and more grandiose than the impression from a visit to the location itself. More surprising however is that this image of the Nieuwe Kerk includes several architectural elements which featured only in the plan, but for financial reasons were eventually not executed in the

ordered the death of all children under the age of two in the city. An angel warned Joseph in a dream that he must flee to Egypt with the child and his mother to escape the massacre. The artist based his composition around a diagonal separation of the sacred (heavenly) space on the left from the profane (earthly) space on the right. In the middle, the Holy Family travels through a Roman landscape, guided by an angel. Each glance denotes a direction or particular dialogue: Joseph questions the angel, Mary looks behind her, symbolizing nostalgia for the past, the donkey plods onward in the shadow towards an uncertain future, while Jesus, in the center of the composition, challenges the viewer. The diagonals in the picture converge in the Virgin\u2019s protective gesture, emphasizing that the flight into Egypt was one of the Seven Sorrows that Mary endured, and foretelling the passion of Christ"}, {"title": "Apotheosis of St. Thomas Aquinas", "artist": "Oil on canvas", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM88OddoMXW1CiuUEItAzmWbyyTPKwh9sViv0yklHoFbqcLY755ku182QQ3nlpmm6dNDhpW8", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landlopers bij een boom", "artist": "Quast, Pieter Jansz", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9ZbPn0ibqxogrZbPfTUA-ztqyfzQekwb0dKoo-yQtzKKC5d8aDxbk1e4szkjsuIZdOK_l1YUc", "desc": null}, {"title": "Door dromen geplaagde slaper", "artist": "Lairesse, Gerard de", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8qpvdijd-7_A_bcFCJt_R3IeYwagLwit7HSIWCrI7oXeq4Ut4OlhB80aNJHkuBx9RNo1L8dOg", "desc": null}, {"title": "View of Dordrecht", "artist": "Aelbert Cuyp", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM80ORPVxWWOdAomGaFztsh2VQBAmjd7VnQZL2rPLVJEByFIZRiWhHH1XVCvMKnCgGEwW2JWifU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Beggar Woman with Rosary", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-gOM7Ubw3rMwo9VW4M5gtjtWFH1HRTZ_SXeEwguewCA6jEwnw6O34m0TuwLsn8RcUANAHM5A", "desc": null}, {"title": "De verkondiging aan Maria", "artist": "Velde, Adriaen van de", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-gfwCcyzo0uTszAG600JyItKGoj3BeZkWV334ScAn7VRTztTYy_pNhYjFtSQWoUnjPc33XwA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Nederlands oorlogsschip", "artist": "Hollar, Wenceslaus", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9lbghTLeRgzFDzRaVyrLvLFrLmEerzOLH-BJJ2sRuXQvUgVlM_IKnhj2SBrZg0TIbadNnacl0", "desc": null}, {"title": "San Gennaro intercedes with Christ, the Virgin and the Eternal Father for the end of the plague", "artist": "Luca Giordano", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM88AiaCqvUSR9HncMtHXYUGI-_yO-UNaSj-OJvqRe-PejjzdOfMvZ3llclzWswKslWuPnUwfAA", "desc": "Signed on the right with the letters LF.

Pietro da Cortona drew here with the precision and minute detail of a miniaturist, a marked contrast to his usually more rugged and spontaneous approach. He applied brown washes with the point of the brush, used the pen for hatching and cross-hatching, and finally added delicate white highlights.

The splayed side rails and wheel spokes all thrust outward in repeating lines, charging the stationary wagon with energy. Rubenss experiments with different positions for the rustic wagon and the farmers flail further increase the effect of motion and symmetry.    Rubens varied both his materials and his technique to give the scene immediacy and vigor. The mans red shirt adds to his sense of animation and becomes a focal point of the drawing. Subtle highlights appear in other colors of chalk: yellow inside the wagon, a bit of blue on the barn roof, and touches of brown on wagon wheels and the ground.

During the transfer to Munich of the royal inheritance it was forgotten, and thus remained in the D\u00fcsseldorf Collection. Today, it is considered one of the masterpieces of the Collection and is the first version Rubens painted on the theme. He created it shortly after returning from Italy. The tragic farewell the lovers bid each other is touching and edifying at once. Knowing full well that Adonis will be killed by a wild boar, neither Venus nor Amor can prevent him from going hunting.

Van der Meer (c. 1574-1637) was a brewer, sheriff, burgomaster on more than one occasion and an officer of the civic guard. In his post of captain he was also painted by Frans Hals in the civic guard portrait of 1616. The couple were portrayed in two separate paintings, which belong together. The wall in one portrait appears to continue through into the other. Traditionally the portrait of the man hangs on the left and that of the woman on the right. In the course of his long career Frans Hals painted many of these pendant portraits of men and women.There is something strange going on with these two portraits. X-radiographs have revealed that the faces of Nicolaes and Cornelia have been painted over the top of other portraits. We do not know why this was done.

Late afternoon light coming in through the open window enhances the quiet spirituality of the scene. Steen\u2019s painting reflects the ideal of a pious and harmonious Dutch family.

The latter was constructed on the site of a fountain that had been built there in 1574\u20131576. In place of the \u201cMoro\u201d, Bernini originally planned a Triton group for the centre of the basin. The clay model in Berlin, which survives as a fragment, gives a sense of what it would have looked like. A design drawing preserved at Windsor Castle shows that the temperamentally agitated bodies of the two mythic hybrid sea creatures were each to have been borne up by two dolphins, from whose mouths the water would have flowed. Despite its fragmentary state, the sheer vividness of the Berlin bozzetto makes Bernini\u2019s mastery in modelling and in physiognomic characterization fully apparent"}, {"title": "Beggars Receiving

While the former was painted when Rubens was about 35 or 36 years old, this painting dates from his early 50s. This study is thought to have been a preparatory work for a tapestry, and originally formed a pair with Justice (private collection), also by Rubenss hand. The young woman in the center of the composition represents Abundance, and the cornucopia, symbol of abundance, is placed on her lap. The fruits that spill forth from the cornucopia symbolize the goodness of nature for mankind. Two putti are shown gathering the fruit that spills forth. The purse under the womans foot represents material treasures in contrast with the natural treasures of the cornucopia. This is a superb preparatory work in oils by Rubenss own hand.

From 1625 to 1631 Rembrandt set up his studio in the home of his parents in Leiden, where he worked to gain recognition as a history painter. He produced drawings such as this in preparation for paintings and etchings. Inspired by people he saw on the streets, beggars and vagabonds were popular subjects for Rembrandt. He incorporated them as bystanders in his biblical compositions, where they served as reminders of the Christian duty of giving alms.

Although Rosa foregrounds the violent cruelty of witchcraft, situating the grotesque hags in the full light of day introduces a comic aspect to the scene. Rosas use of comedy and the unexpected to critique the world around him stemmed from the satirical poetry he wrote throughout his stay in Florence and his return to Rome in 1649.

In the story, Jupiter takes the form of a shower of gold and impregnates Dana\u00eb, who then gives birth to Perseus. This subject was often exploited by artists as an opportunity to depict an erotic female nude. Here, Cupid pulls back the luxuriant dark green curtain to allow the god to enter the bedchamber, and the viewer too is invited to witness the moment of seduction. A transparent veil is draped across Dana\u00eb, though rather than covering her modesty, the fabric creates a tantalizing and sensual focal point on her body.

The Dutch people who had struggled for centuries to free themselves from Spanish rule and the Catholic church felt their fight for religious and political freedom paralleled the history of the ancient Jewish nation. The emerging Dutch Republic saw itself as the spiritual descendent of ancient Jewry. Recent scholarship suggests, however, that Dutch tolerance of the Jews who emigrated to Amsterdam reflects rather the insignificant numbers of new arrivals, relative to the expanding native population. Secondly, the Jews lived together in new parts of the city, away from the major centers, and tried to remain obscure in their daily activities.Rembrandt lived on the Jewish street, the Jodenbreestraat, as did other artists, and it is known that he employed Jews as models for many of his biblical paintings. A keen observer of daily life, he may have considered the \"Semitic\" looks of his Jewish neighbors to be appropriate for the biblical heroes and heroines he was portraying.Spanish and Portuguese Jews began to settle in Amsterdam in the 1590s, Ashkenazi Jews came from Germany in the 1620s; and in 1648-49, Polish Jews fled the infamous Chmielnicki pogroms and sought refuge there. With each new wave of immigration, those Jews already established in the Dutch community felt uncomfortable and embarrassed by the awkward newcomers. By 1648, the Jewish community of Amsterdam was a large and diverse group.Rembrandt examines the theme of isolation, perhaps the isolation felt by newcomers within the established Jewish community, in this etching of Jews in the Synagogue. A lone figure, seated on a stone ledge with his back toward the viewer, is the focus of the composition, visually and thematically. Rembrandt renders his body in full light, whereas the other figures, four pairs of men, move into and out of the light. They wear the costumes of German and Polish Jews and the artist has made no attempt to divide the groups by their native dress. Thus, the theme of isolation is directed at the single figure. Lost in his own thoughts, he is unaware that he is being observed by the viewer or by some of the other men who mill around him. They gather in an undefined space, which some scholars have suggested is the interior of a synagogue. Though no such structure existed in Amsterdam in 1648, the space is probably meant to evoke a religious setting. Rembrandts treatment of Jews in this etching is a sympathetic but astute observation of individuals within the diverse community"}, {"title": "Plate 17: The Romans Misled by Civilis' Horse to Believe that He was Dead or Injured, from The War of the Romans Against the Batavians (Romanorvm et Batavorvm societas)", "artist": "Antonio Tempesta", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-Zl2-GLbuCyuXNeC3SoCAFWSnDkkdzTlG_Ic6MLoEk8d1yiyXStVfnavppxVgqyJQaRQ3T_5VT", "desc": null}, {"title": "Piet\u00e0", "artist": "Juan de Vald\u00e9s Leal", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-a6YOW332Lx4X8e15YqEt7d-bAS_O5xKpeJ4t5lZOae5zC_-upk04GxwQpPQPjTi8W9ArxstI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Dood vecht tegen de mensheid, ca. 1707-1708", "artist": "Bolswert, Bo\u00ebtius Adamsz", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_6xuXrBsFdOPsqvJhYk52-qF9nQ5UCncJX9vWNQWe0-a00nDQUH1xajrsKzjn0jJ6zgoQXHg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landschap met Argus bij Io als koe en Mercurius in de lucht", "artist": "Bolswert, Bo\u00ebtius Adamsz", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-cn6y4OlwJXUgRxs1hwTxJmdDfHVs7r8axCdNsSXvZYmlYg1kgkW384scXJ8nbtcD3S2dNEbke", "desc": null}, {"title": "Lady Mary Villiers, Later Duchess of Richmond and Lennox (1622-1685), with Charles Hamilton, Lord Arran (circa 1630-1640)", "artist": "Anthony van Dyck", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM94MbZOCE_hQwO8SdTawc-qKWc0LECJBAH2f-4m71ZXJ7qtE1JaTdTULn85eHcStqj6QSsrEg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Still Life with Fruit and Goldfinch", "artist": "Juan de Zurbar\u00e1n", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8XdBzkI3UYHP4ugz2WwJTFBgPn0G8teWVj2Yto2hYUAN_iXhIs9T5f2m2hM-nw57NFXFqzaNO5", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Vision (L'apparition)", "artist": "Claude Lorrain", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-KdfVTFF_c6daV7qp9PgbpxAqkAsUcyz-PHoAMj7Uy1Cfq8srWX4ZH0-uQ8K1lOx-asgYJaQo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portret van Willem Jansz.

renewed boom for the cult of Johns saints (Evangelist and Baptist), especially in convents, that frequently devoted an altarpiece to each of them. This John the Baptist was made by Alonso Cano during his Seville period for the church of San Juan de la Palma. The oval faces, almond-shaped eyes, straight hair and the absorbed and melancholic glance, that seem to hold a deep inside world, are one of his most unique features, clearly noticeable in this Saint John. Sitting on some rocks, he has an adolescent body of classical beauty and an absorbed expression, creating a much imitated archetype. He extends his announcing right hand, like following a silent reasoning, while he caresses and sadly looks at the lamb that climbs onto his lap with a naturalness that seems to redeem it from his role, which it has as symbolic tribute that symbolizes the sacrifice of Christs Passion. The beauty of the modeled anatomy, the softness of the animals skin that covers part of his body, the balance in the stance and the calm he irradiates, all features that are more an artistic than a religious concern, make this work one of the most beautiful the Museum has. The reflection of the great naturalism achieved in Baroque works are also the beautiful polychromy of the skin -where we can see the different nuances of the color of the cheeks-, the sinking of the bones, the incipient beard, the faint blue of the veins and the thin hairs of the temple"}, {"title": "Jacob Receiving Joseph's Blood-Stained Cloak (recto); Study of a Bearded Man and The Sacrifice of Isaac (verso)", "artist": "Nicolaes Maes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM88d9Ktewta1dHNsSrT_bEwGE8VKWpZ2AR8eXgDCXcudLr3M--TvgVQvmQ7UtfnVZx7hO6iD33I", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landscape in Latium with Farm Laborers", "artist": "Claude Lorrain", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8t5D6U8Jwo4hjQBLM9t9oxYX7IKzLOq1xZb3QW0_-kE2I2EjjtxtpLD-VQ_HKA9LKZRXjm9OjA", "desc": "Landscape painter Claude Lorrain rarely depicted scenes of everyday life.

Pentimenti over the mountain peak at left show that Claude lowered its height to open the upper third of the sheet to sky. His spontaneity in rendering this scene suggests that it was probably sketched on the spot.   Claude used both paper and chalk to infuse the scene with his characteristic atmospheric effects.

Die im Bild dargestellte Szene spielt auf einer Insel, wo der Kreuzritter Rinaldo, dem Gesang einer Najade lauschend, eingeschlafen ist. Um die Eroberung Jerusalems durch die Kreuzritter zu verhindern, hatte die Zauberin Armida ihn in diesen Hinterhalt gelockt, um ihn zu ermorden. Beim Anblick des schlafenden Rinaldo verliebt sie sich jedoch in ihn, fesselt ihn mit einem Blumenkranz und entf\u00fchrt ihn. Eine Wassernymphe (Najade) h\u00e4lt im Bild ein Notenblatt in der Hand, das auf ihren Gesang verweist; zahlreiche Putten versinnbildlichen die amour\u00f6se Thematik. Die in starker Untersicht wiedergegebene Darstellung ist in ihrer Komposition virtuos und l\u00e4sst unter anderem im Kolorit deutliche Bez\u00fcge zur venezianischen Malerei des 16. Jahrhunderts erkennen. Seit einer \u00dcbersetzung von 1600 lag das Gedicht Tassos auch in englischer Sprache vor und war am Hof des englischen K\u00f6nigs Charles I. (1600-1649) sehr beliebt, der Anton van Dyck (1599-1641) 1629 beauftragte, eine Darstellung des Themas anzufertigen (das Gem\u00e4lde befindet sich heute im Baltimore Museum of Art). Das Potsdamer Bild ist ebenfalls ein Original Van Dycks, das das Gem\u00e4lde in Baltimore in etwas kleinerem Format wiederholt. Bei der Ersth\u00e4ngung der Bildergalerie im Jahr 1763 dominierten neben den Werken von Peter Paul Rubens vor allem diejenigen Anton van Dycks den Westfl\u00fcgel und den mittleren Kuppelsaal der Bildergalerie. Nur wenige dieser Bilder geh\u00f6rten jedoch zum alten Sammlungsbestand. Die meisten Gem\u00e4lde lie\u00df Friedrich der Gro\u00dfe zur Ausstattung der Bildergalerie auf dem Kunstmarkt erwerben. Van Dycks \"Rinaldo und Armida\" hatte er 1756 neben verschiedenen anderen Bildern aus der ber\u00fchmten Sammlung des Duc de Tallard erwerben lassen.

The marquis was famous for his numerous acts of valor, and in addition, was known as a collector of art. While his collection included works by such representative Spanish painters as Vel\u00e1squez and Ribera, and such Italian artists as Titian, it was particularly noteworthy for the large number of works by such Flemish artists as Rubens and Van Dyck acquired while he served at the palace in Brussels. This portrait is thought to have been painted in Brussels in 1634 when Van Dyck, court painter for the British king Charles I, returned briefly to Flanders. The work exhibits Van Dycks special characteristics, his firm grasp of the subjects individual characteristics and his rich, somewhat idealized form of expression, while the subjects figure and clothing are relatively somber in terms of Van Dycks normal palette. This could have been a result of specific instructions from the marquis, familiar with portraits by such Spanish artists as Vel\u00e1squez. Another work that closely resembles this work is now in Madrid (Spanish-American Bank collection). The painting of secondary areas such as the background and clothing in the NMWA work is simplified and the work lacks an official character. Also, traces of revisions to the right arm, thought to have been painted by Van Dyck himself, indicate that this work was the first of the two to be painted. It can be suggested that the Madrid work was based on the NMWA work as a presentation piece. The number inscribed in the lower right of the composition also confirms that this work was originally in the marquis own collection.

The Carracci brothers began work on the decoration of the Galleria Farnese in Rome, including this fresco, in 1597. For centuries, this cycle of paintings influenced artists as much as Michelangelos Sistine ceiling.Beginning with drawing from life and understanding anatomy, the Carracci focused on painting the human figure. Their drawings of the nude maintained monumental proportions while broadly sketching the bodys essential structure; combining robust energy with soft, rhythmic contours.The fragment of an arm on the verso of this drawing was trimmed from a study of a triton now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, proving that this sheet was once part of a larger one"}, {"title": "The Adoration of the Shepherds", "artist": "Mattia Preti", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_iPRvzMbasaMYyzfttH4D0OL4aYBh60MgjR1-GF2nFXE9IHPxbiQz5880J9xs1fPfASoHDNrA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hercules and the Boar of Erymanthus", "artist": "Antonio Tempesta", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9iWMw3bB3WJ64_ZXfv67LubAgyd-9msqP4vOxtcwn6hCHVak5wESImyenE6rX_pnCYQkXljkON", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Martyrdom of Saint Barnabas", "artist": "Jacques Callot", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM98AvqkFWvgM1LyIwAzcMQpf27552nSrSnxVvQGCIfAKcqp7mzYjh21iaUw0--JIxscIuMBkNqe", "desc": null}, {"title": "Clement de Jonghe", "artist": "Rembrandt van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8tFok-evzYyJv2FMkBC1eaUNkMjkEPZk18OPixCLUquyELHane-319APCsWuIius_PdYTYKch2", "desc": null}, {"title": "Drie bedelaars en een vrouw aan tafel in een herberg", "artist": "Droochsloot, Joost Cornelisz", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9X9JG_ndjXKnoiQihtpWVK9G6ySXHciCsztbkGISvNhU6JAnKac9szInej4SuYbqocH7Rqb7I", "desc": null}, {"title": "Triomfboog van de Munt (achterzijde);

Jupiter, who was enamoured with the mortal princess Europa, the daughter of Agenor, King of Tyre or Sidon in Phoenicia, changed himself into a white bull and mingled with a herd of cattle, while Europa and her attendants were gathering flowers near the seashore. Charmed by the bulls good nature and fine appearance, Europa hung garlands of flowers over its horns and climbed onto its back.  She was carried out to sea, to the island of Crete, where Jupiter resumed his normal shape and ravished her. Claude came from Lorraine, but worked throught his career in Rome, where he was inspired by the ruined architecture of classical antiquity, the intense southern light and the beauty of the Roman countryside. He worked alongside his compatriot, Nicholas Poussin; together they forged a new, more intellectual type of landscape, which was a fitting setting for stories taken from classical mythology. Five versions of this subject by Claude are known, the earliest was painted in 1634. Of these, the one in the Royal Collection is the last and the most sophisticated. The calm mood of the scene is established by the carefully placed trees, the fortification and ships on the horizon, and the pale golden light. The central group seem light-hearted and part of this Arcadian world. Yet the artist has depicted the natural world with great care: the breeze whipping up the water, the waves dashing against the ships, which are moving up and down on the sea, the rocky shore, the flowers on the horns of Jupiter, the grazing cattle and the magnificent trees framing the composition. Claude vividly contrasts the beauty of the setting with the latent violence of the subject and creates a real as well as poetic world"}, {"title": "View of Amsterdam", "artist": "Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-PntlsShRhuGent38ijq0j5mdhc-myp1Ew4maSr0BMeXaL0iHu6QRO5NFqSx5wLK4l4LnCIuU", "desc": "In one of Rembrandt\u2019s first landscape etchings, he looked toward his adopted city of Amsterdam from its dikes to the northeast. The artist had become a citizen of Amsterdam in 1634 and competed in its lively art market. From this view, the city is a thriving bustle of activity with windmills, spires, and ship masts indicating both commercial success and religious convictions. While the structures in this work are identifiable and faithfully recorded (though in reverse), Rembrandt manipulated their proportions and locations to suit his artistic vision.

The clarity of the artistic means and intention of the painter finds its perfect embodiment in the recreation of the tension of the moment. The patient, an ignorant woman, is waiting for the verdict of the dispenser, in unwitting contraposition to the apprentice hidden behind the half-open door, while the ambers in the fireplace spread a mysterious glow.

Such a gesture reflects the affection felt by the pious artist for his confessor, as well as his need to establish a reputation for himself at this early stage of his career"}, {"title": "The Foolish Virgins Rejected", "artist": "Abraham Bosse", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9FZ7dduVMFhjUuuiAE_n6dnjxbOpYvtOo-Fcp2nXptKlcKy8ypTG99lsc-7y4q2fvyp4dh2X8", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Ordeal by Arrows (Saint Sebastian)", "artist": " For more information about this and thousands of other works of art in the NGA collection, please visit\u00a0http://www.nga.gov/", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-XV8dPhdZTISU726y4wLJKX-V0__Cu8IOts9E6FXxNOuTqBMM0Xl-QKSqO0UqDbbTjY3x6AREA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portret van Fran\u00e7ois Bosquet", "artist": "Nanteuil, Robert", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Z03DmqHEz0Owoyg76_8WyptWQpw4xxWD8GBpW_txk0fdwMxBuDOT9Xtc_OI4uG2UUEVVQ9eI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Calvarie", "artist": "Matham, Jacob", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-Ic11GuB77IeAaOUOMEKeaik4F5Sw9xz3SuQF76MF_nxbUv46waIOs14P2vAWDTarXfO9kzKE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Juno", "artist": "Bloemaert, Abraham", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM81mwoRgO1hIWVZjfTmbOEDRvpD814RTrw85TOzSbn2Jf9YFv2RI7ojAXFLm8u7AI4aKXXagtD_", "desc": null}, {"title": "Creation of Eve", "artist": "Oil", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-1GcjkHjNOzp1hqtGes0DPGQL2XByyUPh7G4QD3nFuSVCO_SLS5fM6fDM24nmAXqv1ianbGnU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata", "artist": "Lucas Vorsterman", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-L72C7zz5J8xk4snf1d3yxZFjnRUUe95MUE6vFAeQvwlGfoNPkmKuk8jQgb3FPGqUiDtPz", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portret van Dominique de Ligny", "artist": "Nanteuil, Robert", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_ZJbsOu-J-7EKEUfbdsD6pyV98yJlTIZi_k9VvDPwEhTSw2l1t7oPTgoiV__1vpekfIpiBW7U", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Benedict", "artist": "Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8lXzB2-FHg0hjLXLHWkiIS85gkrCSJ3XkhD0LrrKiN4CPiJfZ8xvSjJsdzB8x_lZBAKoZh5g", "desc": null}, {"title": "Unknown Woman", "artist": "Wenceslaus Hollar", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_gC4HImSiCMVoFA5kQ35XrBJQLQKQ7jIrqZvPI0P0wAD4geRQeq5MMMtQ_GEoFewYoRLAvXQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Heilige Hieronymus", "artist": "Dou, Gerard", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Boe2KANZ_qrKoj3u8_sJOk13KTdvjo3EtUlBYv87iFOINndWQ64EwCHWLfxQaQ6ECHp8ongo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Jupiter's Love Hall: Apollo and Daphne", "artist": "Carlo Cignani", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-rELuxfafn8o3VpiQLPHcuZmJ8FQtqCsREnzqq1_q-zOEFK6XIWtSqGWS1FQIuaEkT0xeGYLE", "desc": "Southern Wall. The Hall of Loves of Jupiter, whose name identifies the subject represented in the varoius painted scenes, the love presented in different type (OMNIA VINCET AMOR-LOVE CONQUERS EVERYTHING), was painted and painted in stuccoes, respectively, by Agostino Carracci (Bolonia 1557-Parma 1602) and Giovanni Bosco. Speaking of this last person, Giovanni, there are some circumstances that are not clear: was often substitued by Luca Rieti, artist of stuccoes who realized in Parma some statues for the Teatro Farnese. Speaking of Carraccis work we can identify the central, eastern, western and southern part of the vault, while the northern one contains an epigraph written by Claudio Achillini for the artisti from Bolonia who passed away in 1602 before finishing the vault. The epitaph says: AUGUSTUS CARRACIUS DUM EXTREMOS IMMORTALIS SUI PENCILLI TRACTUS IN HOC SEMIPICTO FORNICE MOLIRETUR, AB OFFICIIS PINGENDI, ET VIVENDI, SUB UMBRA LILIORUM, GLORIOSE VACAVIT, TU SPECTATOR, INTER HAS DULCES PICTURAE ACERBITATES PASCE OCULOS, ET FATEBERE, DECUISSE POTIUS INTACTAS SPECTARI QUAM, ALIENA MANU, TRACTATAS MATURARI. The stuccoes represent, precisely, the love of Jupiter: Jupiter and Danae, Jupiter and Europa, Jupiter and Seleme, Jupiter and Leda. The decorative apparate complete itself with two arches including the dominion of Eros and the Onnipotence. The pictorial cycle was carried on, in the walls, by Carlo Cignani, always from Bolonia, many years after the death of Carracci, around 1680"}, {"title": "Landschap met twee ezels, geitjes en

Claude Gell\u00e9e was born in Lorrain, but spent most of a productive life in his beloved Italy, especially Rome and its pastoral environs exemplified in the Campagna. Initially inspired by northern artists active in that city, Elsheimer and Bril for example, Claude became fluent in the idealising vocabulary of Bolognese painters such as Domenichino.

Mary, the mother of Christ, cradles his head and looks heavenward for divine intercession.    The Entombment  was meant to make the viewers religious experience personal and encourage the faithful to imagine the physical horror of Christs Crucifixion. Christs tortured features confront the viewer, and our attention is focused on his corpse, sacrifice, and suffering. Wounds are openly displayed: blood flows from the gaping laceration in Christs side and the puncture wounds on his hands. Rubens contrasted the living and the dead by juxtaposing the lifeless body and green-tinged skin of Christ with the healthy complexion of St. John.   This painting was probably made to serve as an altarpiece in a small chapel, perhaps one dedicated to the Eucharist.

Born in Antwerp, where he studied with Pieter Bruegel the Younger, by the late 1640s Coques was in Holland, working for the stadtholders Frederick Henry and Amelia van Solms. Thirty years later, in 1671, he became court painter to the Count of Monterrey, the governor of the southern Netherlands. His style is similarly an integration of the two traditions. The principal influences on his work come from Flanders; his elegant figures appear to be miniature versions of those of Van Dyck, while the (obviously imaginary) architecture derives from Rubenss family portraits and conversation pieces (conversatie), like Garden of Love (Prado, Madrid) of 1636. Coques also seeks to emulate the informality with which Rubens depicts his own family, an effect which can also be see in Philip Fruytierss watercolour of Four Children of Peter Paul Rubens and Helena Fourment with Two Maids of 1638-9. However, it was Dutch artists who specialised in the depiction on a small scale of boisterous families, with indulgent parents and rowdy children, set in a lucid architectural space. There are excellent examples by Frans Hals, Family Group of c.1635 (Cincinnati Museum, Ohio), and Pieter de Hooch, Family in a Courtyard in Delft of 1658-60 (Vienna Academy). When he acquired this picture, George IV already owned a Family Group of the same type by the less well-known Dutch artist Barent Graat, dated 1658. The sitters here can be identified by the coat of arms on the huge curtain: Jan-Baptista Anthoine, knight and postmaster of Antwerp, is shown with his wife Susanna de Lannoy, two sons, Louis and Jan-Baptista, and two daughters, Maria-Alexandrina and Barbara Catharina. Anthoines inventory mentions a family portrait by Gonsael (Gonzales). It is perhaps significant, in view of the elegant quality of this image, that he also owned Van Dycks grisaille of Rinaldo and Armida (National Gallery, London). Though wishing to convey a mood of indulgent informality, Coques is perhaps more anxious than Frans Hals might be to suggest that each member of the family plays an appropriate role. The eldest son, who will inherit the title, plays at being a knight (that is a cavalier or horseman) with a hobbyhorse and plumed hat. The eldest daughter tends her younger sister or brother in a group which seems to have been derived from Van Dycks Five Eldest Children of Charles I. The father stands against the view of the garden; the mother sits with her children within the space of the room. This effect is made more pronounced by the remarkable perspective of the painting, which requires the eye of the viewer to be situated very close to the painting at its right-hand edge. Jan-Baptista Anthoine is seen against a long avenue of trees, which evokes the link between the formal garden and the surrounding land of an aristocrats country estate. The rest of the family are seen in strikingly oblique perspective (as can be seen from the deformation of the square floor tiles), as if out of the corner of the eye.

Adriaen van Utrecht, along with Frans Snyders and Jan Fyt, is known as one of the major painters of this genre.\tA wood pigeon, a hare and a goose are seen hanging upside down on the left side of this painting. The hares head and two forelegs, and the head of the goose hang onto the tabletop. A pheasant is in the center of the composition, with its head and neck hanging off the front of the table. A large copper bucket is placed to the right of the pheasant and the artists signature and the paintings date of 1648 are inscribed on the bucket.

His earliest paintings, from the early 1650s, include many images like this and Calm: A States Yacht, a barge and other vessels (RCIN 407275), depicting perfectly calm seas with a dense arrangement of ships, sometimes now called naval parades. The type was invented by marine painters of the previous generation, in particular Jan van de Cappelle, and would seem to depict the Netherlands inland sea, the Zuider Zee, which included many of the most important Dutch ports - Amsterdam, Hoorn, Enkhuizen and Kampen - and where large numbers of ships might lie at anchor in relative safety. Though the atmosphere might be studied from the life, the particular variety of shipping in such close proximity looks imaginary. Both these calms have states yachts providing an obvious focus of interest, in this case by its size, in the case of  Calm: A States Yacht, a barge and other vessels by its central position and the fact that a dignitary is being rowed out to it in a barge. It is tempting to read both images as a Great Republic of Vessels with every type, size and function of shipping from the humblest upwards, peaceably coexisting under the protection of the senatorial government yacht. The ships in question can be identified through the comparison with the drawings of Willem van de Velde the Elder; to the left of the yacht is a pont in the foreground, behind this a kaag and hoekers in the distance. Reading to the right from the yacht is a kaag, two smalschepen, a hoeker next to a Pont and a weyschuit in the right foreground. The artists already mentioned as Willem van de Veldes inspiration for images such as this - Simon de Vlieger and Jan van de Cappelle - were both exponents of the tonal style of seascape, initially pioneered by Jan Porcellis. The best way of understanding this painting and the following is to imagine Willem van de Velde setting out to paint a tonal painting and striving not to sacrifice any of its atmospheric unity, while at the same time adding those elements which tonal painting lacks - bright colour and a thick, opaque and smooth paint surface. In the lower part of this painting the boats, ripples and sand are beautifully unified in a close, grey-brown tonal range. This is also a perfect example of going with the grain, an effect whereby the paint follows and suggests the grain of the wood panel while at the same time evoking the clinker boats and ripples of water. The sky contains thicker paint, purer white and brighter blue than any tonal painting, and yet colour and tone are controlled in such a way as to retain an effect of atmospheric unity. By this means the viewer is made to feel that there is a veil of moist, sunlit air between their eye and every surface in the painting"}, {"title": "Minerva", "artist": "Hendrick Goltzius", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9LnlFTfpfc8ZjmHhbDfO-GQBDYECs_JikCTZSLCR5qUuosrQDeu9xQV1AmGNgfHlUX_OeUxg", "desc": "For centuries these three paintings of life-size nudes, the goddess Minerva, the god Mercury and the hero Hercules, have been an inseparable trio. And yet they were not all painted in the same year.  Goltzius painted the Minerva and Mercury in 1611; the Hercules and Cacus followed in 1613, and may well have been commissioned by the Haarlem lawyer and town councillor Johan Colterman (c. 1565-1616), who probably had his 22-year-old son Johan Colterman Junior model for the young, powerful figure of Hercules. This painting is not quite the same size as the two earlier works and its original frame was also slightly different. The earliest mention of the paintings hanging together dates from 1671, when they belonged to the daughter and son-in-law of Colterman Junior. The three paintings together exemplify the humanist educational ideal. Theory (Mercury) and practice (Minerva) lead to skill and virtue.

In an event from one of the greatest love stories in Greek mythology, Cupid stands with his arrow poised to strike, while his mother Venus points to his target, the mortal Psyche. Because of Psyches beauty, people had begun to worship her rather than Venus. Outraged at this mortal usurping her honor, Venus commanded Cupid to avenge her. Cupid, however, foiled his mothers plans, and Psyche did not fall in love with any such wretched creature. Having pricked himself with his own arrow so that he would love Psyche, Cupid protected her. His enraged mother subjected the lovers to many trials before their eventual marriage.   Pieter van Lint copied this subject from the corner of a curved ceiling in a Roman villa that was painted by Raphaels pupils in 1518.

In this two-and-a-half foot marble portrait, Bernini depicts the pope almost bareheaded, his hair styled in the \"tonsure of St. Peter,\" a practice that signified the renunciation of worldly fashion, and dressed in traditional pontifical vestments. The thick cope covering his shoulders is richly decorated with embroidery of the patron saints of Rome, the Apostles Peter (holding his keys and a book) and Paul (holding the sword of his martyrdom and a book). While he is robed in the garments of the papacy, Pope Paul V gazes at the viewer with a natural expression, his face individualized by the slight turn of his head, the delicate contours of his forehead and the tiny wrinkles carved around his eyes. At this time, Bernini is already making the dynamic sculptures for which he will become famous, yet here his subject requires restraint. The artists subdued dynamism can best be seen in the folds of drapery at the sitters left shoulder, suggesting his body moves underneath. This bust was kept in the Villa Borghese in Rome until 1893 and then sold. Its whereabouts have been unknown until its rediscovery in late 2014.
