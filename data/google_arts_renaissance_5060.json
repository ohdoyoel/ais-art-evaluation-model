He commissioned Bruegel to create a series of six seasonal paintings, the last of which is shown here. The series also included: Gloomy Day (Early Spring; KHM, GG 1837),  Spring (now lost); Hay-Harvest (Early Summer; Nelahozeves Castle, Czech Republic, Lobkowitz Collection); The Harvesters (Late Summer; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art); Return of the Herd (Autumn; KHM, GG 1018). For the composition of this series, Bruegel, who today is regarded as the most progressive landscape painter of the 16th century, followed an older tradition that divided the year, beginning on 1 March, into six unequally long seasons. What all the compositions have in common is the so-called balcony motif, i.e., the depiction of a hill in the foreground from which an overall view of the landscape unfolds. On top of the hill a group of hunters accompanied by a pack of dogs is seen, making their way back to the village below. Their catch is poor: a single fox dangling from the spear the hunter on the left carries on his shoulder. To the hunter\u2019s left, Bruegel added a motif that had been used forquire some time in book illumination for depicting the month of December: the preparations for singeing a pig over an open fire outside a building. The damaged sign hanging above them reveals the name of the inn: \u201cdit is inden Hert\u201d, meaning \u201cTo the Deer\u201d \u2013 a well-aimed passing shot. Entertaining details, such as the people ice-skating on the frozen lakes, have contributed to the painting\u2019s enormous popularity. However, it does not owe its significance in art history to its details but rather to the overall impression conveyed by the coloration and composition. With virtuosity and consistency Bruegel evokes the impression of cold: white, blue-green and brown are the dominant colours. The precise silhouette of the trees, the frozen mill-wheel at the lower right and the icy surface of the snow revealed by the hunters\u2019 footprints blend together to convey the fundamental characteristics of winter. The scene is an invented, universally formulated landscape: the combination of a chain of Alpine mountains with Flemish architecture renders pointless any search for reality."}, {"title": "Der ungl\u00e4ubige Thomas", "artist": "Oil on canvas", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-9onUNxnKQHnRTMCE2-5pcXCyNlDM9sTU_9w44gAnV18jwuLqRPx0oKqbu3IO4TUfMqrR7DKs", "desc": "Die Arbeiten von Caravaggio (1571-1610) zeichnen sich durch einen ausgepr\u00e4gten Naturalismus in der Darstellung und starke Licht-Schatten-Kontraste aus.

In ihrer bedeutenden, im Palazzo Giustiniani untergebrachten Kunstsammlung pr\u00e4sentierten sie insgesamt 15 Gem\u00e4lde des Meisters , darunter auch \"Der ungl\u00e4ubige Thomas\".

Der Ankauf erfolgte bereits im Hinblick auf die Einrichtung eines \u00f6ffentlichen Kunstmuseums in Berlin, weshalb die Gem\u00e4lde nicht in die Kunstsammlungen der preu\u00dfischen Schl\u00f6sser integriert wurden.

Die Komposition, basierend auf einer Episode des Johannesevangeliums (Joh 20, 24-29), ist in dunklen Braunt\u00f6nen gehalten, die zentralen Figuren Christus und Thomas werden von einem von links einfallenden Lichtschein beleuchtet und hervorgehoben. Christus, mit blasser Haut und in einem wei\u00dfen Gewand dargestellt, f\u00fchrt die Hand des Apostels, um ihn von seiner Wiederauferstehung zu \u00fcberzeugen, die dieser zuvor angezweifelt hatte.

Only the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, who collaborated with the Romans, combined records from different sources to create the legend that became accepted (Antiquitates Judaica I,4; 93\u201394 AD).In the book illumination of the Early and High Middle Ages, local buildings that were less than monumental were used as models for the architecture of the Tower of Babel. Starring in the 16th century, artists orientated themselves on theMesopotamian type of step-shaped ziggurat (temple tower), which, however, was rectangular rather than round. Bruegel\u2019s monumental composition had several forerunners in Netherlandish painting, but his work became the most famous classic among the Tower of Babel depictions and was frequently copied in many different variations. The sense of scale is provided by the flemish-style port city, which is impressively tiny in comparison to the tower. With meticulous precision and encyclopaedic interest Bruegel depicts an abundance of technical and mechanical details, from the supply of the building materials in the busy harbour to the various cranes and the scaffolding on the unfinished brick foundation. He sets the workers\u2019 dwellings into the stone outer structure, which blends elements of classical with Romanesque architecture, and they appear to be more than merely temporary. By anchoring the building on the rocky slope, Bruegel creates the impression of static equilibrium. Reaching up to the clouds, the building, however, isoptically distorted and appears to have slightly sunk into the ground on the left side. This is an artistic gesture, on the one hand enhancing the impression of thebuilding\u2019s monumentality, and on the other hand alluding to human hubris and the impossibility of completing the tower because \u201cthe Lord confused the language of all the earth\u201d.

From outside, where it is still daylight, other guests are pressing into the room. One of the bagpipe-players draws our attention to the front, where he looks with curiosity at the meagre fare that is being freshly served. Two helpers are using a door that has been taken off its hinges to carry their dishes. A server who is pouring beer into more easily handled jugs and a child eating to one side close off the painting at the front. If we follow the figure at the end of the table who is passing the dishes to the wedding guests, we are led to the true protagonist, the bride. She is sitting silently in front of a length of green cloth, which has been hung along with a paper crown in her honour on the straw wall. According to Flemish custom, the bridegroom was not allowed to attend the celebrations until the evening, and the bride was not permitted either to eat or to speak beforehand. Unfortunately nothing is known about the commissioning of this work, which is probably Bruegel\u2019s most famous. If we knew more, it might help to resolve the controversial question of whether the painting is intended to be a caricature or carry a moralising message. Bruegel scholars in Vienna agree, however, that most of the interpretative proposals made thus far have failed to reveal the true meaning of the painting.

Turning his back on the then-dominant Italian models, he plunges into the then old-fashioned tradition of Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s world. An apparently inextricable mixture of persons and shapes offers itself to our bewildered gaze. Emerging from distant depths in a halo of light, monsters are thrown to earth as from a breaking wave. Angels combat them, led by St Michael, thin as a rake in his golden armour, striking with his sword at the dragon with the seven crowned heads on which he has his foothold. The combat of the archangel with the fallen angels is described in the Book of Revelation (12, 3-9) and was frequently illustrated from the Middle Ages onwards.

By borrowing minutiously observed elements from the plant, animal, mineral and human worlds and combining them to form hybrid, deformed beings, Bruegel invents creatures that are the most repulsive, but also the most curious and fantastic imaginable. Mussel shells grafted onto a gigantic shrimp, a human head with butterfly wings attached to a shapeless, bloated body, a puffy gnome carrying a sundial and with a plumed helmet on his head, viscous fish with arms, lizard scales, crustacean paws\u2026 a seemingly endless list. Within the m\u00eal\u00e9e, every element is differentiated by the scrupulous rendering of the textures. With their long, refined silhouettes, St Michael\u2019s allies, elegantly garbed in delicate, luminously coloured albs, are automatically on the side of the Good, in a state of grace that enables them to dominate effortlessly the monstrous hordes, moving around in a clear and azure sky which is in profound contrast with the darkness reserved for the rebels.

Especially under the influence of Leonardo\u2019s compositions, the newcomer created a series of Madonna depictions. Particularly in Florence, the Madonna image had experienced a change in function: it was no longer mainly a religious item for practical use, but primarily an exquisite expression of artistic achievement. Raphael gave the Madonna in the Meadow to his Florentine patron Taddeo Taddi as a gift; in 1662 it was acquired at its place of origin by Archduke Ferdinand Karl of Tirol. In keeping with the Sienese type of the Madonna Humilitatis the Virgin Maryis sitting on an elevation on the ground. Supporting the infant Jesus with both hands, she looks at little John the Baptist. The encounter of the two children has been mentioned in Tuscan devotional literature since the late 13th century. The cross is simultaneously a toy, an attribute of John the Baptist and a Passion symbol. The latter is also true of the conspicuously positioned poppy on the right. In the present painting, which was created at the beginning of his series of full-length Madonna depictions, Raphael decided on a strictly geometrical structure: the group is incorporated in an equilateral triangle. However, within the seemingly rigid structure, a lively scene unfolds.

In July 1512 the Vatican received the news that the northern Italian town of Piacenza had joined the Papal States. It is assumed that this event prompted the Pope to commission the painting. The \"Sistine Madonna\" was intended for the monastery church of San Sisto in Piacenza, with which the Pope was associated on account of close family contacts. Raphael had probably already been completed the work by the time of the Popes death in February 1513. The painting: The \"Sistine Madonna\" is one of the worlds most famous Renaissance masterpieces. It depicts a vision appearing to saints in the clouds. In the centre of the picture the Virgin strides towards the earthly realm whilst holding the Christ Child in her arms.

On the right-hand side is the meekly kneeling figure of St. Barbara, who also suffered martyrdom in the third century.

Als Letzterer verf\u00fcgt er \u00fcber ein \u00dcberma\u00df an schwarzer Galle. Im Mittelalter noch negativ beurteilt, wurde die Melancholie im 15. Jahrhundert von italienischen Neuplatonikern zum Temperament des Genies, des K\u00fcnstlers und Intellektuellen erhoben. Angesichts der Endlichkeit seiner Existenz gegen\u00fcber der Unendlichkeit der Sch\u00f6pfung empfindet der melancholicus Schwermut und Trauer. Aus seinem Leiden an der Welt gewinnt er jedoch zugleich den wesentlichen Impuls f\u00fcr sein Schaffen. F\u00fcr diesen Zwiespalt zwischen Kreativit\u00e4t und Schwermut, dem Erkennen der Komplexit\u00e4t der Welt und dem Verzweifeln daran fand D\u00fcrer in seinem \u00bbMelencolia\u00ab-Kupferstich eine bis heute g\u00fcltige Bildformel.

Bruegel d\u00fcrfte dort zwischen 1525 und 1530 geboren worden sein. Kaiser Karl V. (1500-1558), der die Niederlande regierte, war damals etwa 30 Jahre alt und Philipp II. (1527-1598) gerade zur Welt gekommen. Es war die Zeit, da sich die Niederlande eines ungew\u00f6hnlichen Wohlstandes erfreuten. Als Bruegel starb, war das Land von den S\u00f6ldnern des Herzogs von Alba ausgepl\u00fcndert, w\u00e4hrend das Volk zu den Waffen griff, um sich zu verteidigen. Vor dem Hintergrund dieser wechselvollen Geschichte entfaltete sich das Schaffen Bruegels, des bedeutendsten und genialsten K\u00fcnstlers seiner Zeit. 1551 war Bruegel als freier Meister in die Antwerpener Malerzunft aufgenommen worden. Kurz darauf reiste er nach Italien, wo er sich einige Jahre aufhielt. Es war jedoch nicht die Kunst der Antike oder die der italienischen Maler, sondern die grandiose Szenerie der Alpen, das Tessintal und die Gegend um den St. Gotthard, die bei ihm einen tiefen Eindruck hinterlie\u00df und seine Landschaftsgestaltung entscheidend bestimmt hat. 1555 befand sich Bruegel wieder in Antwerpen, wo er f\u00fcr den Verleger Hieronymus Cock Zeichnungen lieferte, die in Stichen Verbreitung erlangten. 1563 hatte Bruegel in Br\u00fcssel die Tochter des Malers Pieter Coecke van Aelst geheiratet, der nach dem Bericht von Carel van Mander (1604) sein Lehrmeister gewesen ist. In Antwerpen lie\u00df Bruegel zahlreiche Freunde zur\u00fcck. Zu ihnen geh\u00f6rte der Humanist und Geograph Abraham Ortelius (1527-1598), der Bruegel in jene Kreise der durch die Weltanschauung des Erasmus gepr\u00e4gten Katholiken eingef\u00fchrt hatte, die aus innerster \u00dcberzeugung die Intoleranz von Staat und Kirche verurteilten. Der Sinn f\u00fcr Toleranz und Menschlichkeit, der aus den Werken Bruegels spricht und uns heute noch so un - mittelbar ber\u00fchrt, ist im Kreise der Antwerpener Freunde vertieft worden. Doch auch in Br\u00fcssel fand Bruegel bald neue F\u00f6rderer. Zu ihnen z\u00e4hlte kein geringerer als Kardinal Antoine Perrenot de Granvella (1517-1586), der Vertraute Philipps II. von Spanien und Berater der Statthalterin Margarete von Parma. Den Kunstfreunden seiner Zeit galt Bruegel als kongenialer Nachfolger des im Jahre 1516 verstorbenen Hieronymus Bosch. Abraham Ortelius ehrte seinen fr\u00fch verstorbenen Freund durch einen in Latein abgefa\u00dften Nachruf (um 1573), in dem es hei\u00dft: \u00bbVon den Manen verehrt, war Pieter Bruegel zweifelsohne der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Maler seiner Zeit, das w\u00fcrde niemand je zu leugnen wagen, h\u00f6chstens ein Eifers\u00fcchtiger, ein Rivale oder ein Mensch, dem die Kunst dieses Meisters vollkommen fremd ist. Um alles zu sagen, w\u00fcrde ich sogar wiederholen, er sei nicht nur der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Maler, sondern er sei f\u00fcr sich allein schon die ganze Welt der Bilder. Und dieser Bruegel, den ich preise, hat viele Dinge gemalt, die nicht gemalt werden k\u00f6nnen, wie einst Plinius sagte, als er von Apelles sprach. In allen seinen Werken trachtet er stets danach, mehr zu verstehen zu geben, als was er uns zur Betrachtung vorlegt.\u00ab Im Schaffen Bruegels bezeichnen die Jahre 1559 und 1560 einen deutlichen Einschnitt. Es entstanden die niederl\u00e4ndischen Sprichw\u00f6rter sowie zwei in Wien (Kunsthistorisches Museum) bewahrte Gem\u00e4lde, der Streit zwischen Fasching und Fasten und die Kinderspiele. Diese ersten gro\u00dfen Bilder stehen am Beginn einer reichen Gem\u00e4ldeproduktion, die den Ruhm des K\u00fcnstlers begr\u00fcndete und noch heute die Bewunderung des Betrachters erregt. Die niederl\u00e4ndische Sprache zur Zeit Bruegels besa\u00df einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Schatz an Sprichw\u00f6rtern, als dies heute der Fall ist. Erasmus von Rotterdams \u00bbAdagiorum Collectanea\u00ab, die ber\u00fchmte Sammlung lateinischer sprichw\u00f6rtlicher Redewendungen, ist eines der sch\u00f6nsten Beispiele f\u00fcr die auch von Bruegel geteilte Vorliebe f\u00fcr das Sprichwort, die in seiner Darstellung der niederl\u00e4ndischen Sprichw\u00f6rter wahrhaft enzyklop\u00e4disches Ausma\u00df angenommen hat. Unmittelbar vor der Vollendung dieses Bildes hat Bruegel in einer Zeichnung den \u00bbElck\u00ab, das hei\u00dft den sprichw\u00f6rtlichen Vertreter des \u00bbJedermann\u00ab dargestellt, der mit der Laterne in der Hand F\u00e4sser, K\u00f6rbe und S\u00e4cke durchw\u00fchlt. Dabei ist er nur auf seinen Gewinn bedacht, ebenso wie jene M\u00e4nner, die verbissen an den Enden eines Tuches ziehen. In der Beischrift des nach der Zeichnung gefertigten Stiches hei\u00dft es: \u00bb\u00dcberall auf der Welt sieht jeder sich selbst, und in allen Dingen will er sich selbst finden. Wie k\u00f6nnte einer sich selbst finden, wenn jeder sich selbst sucht? Jeder rei\u00dft sich um den Vorteil (das l\u00e4ngere Ende), die einen von oben, die andern von unten. Fast niemand kennt sich selbst. Wer das erkennt, wird gro\u00dfe Wunder sehen.\u00ab Die in diesen Worten ausgedr\u00fcckte Erkenntnis liefert zweifellos einen der wichtigsten Anhaltspunkte f\u00fcr das Verst\u00e4ndnis des Sprichw\u00f6rterbildes. In diesem Bild sind zum ersten Mal mehr als 100 Sprichw\u00f6rter und Redewendungen mit einander vereint und in eine Umgebung versetzt, die ebenso real ist wie die durch die Spruchweisheiten in knapper und treffender Form enth\u00fcllten Verhaltensweisen des Menschen. Dabei spielen die einzelnen Szenen gleichzeitig nebeneinander, ohne unmittelbar voneinander abh\u00e4ngig zu sein, ganz so, wie es der Zufall im menschlichen Leben mit sich bringen k\u00f6nnte. Ein Dorf an einem Flu\u00df nahe dem Meer bildet die weitr\u00e4umige B\u00fchne f\u00fcr das scheinbar allt\u00e4gliche Treiben seiner Bewohner. Ein Bauernhaus, bauf\u00e4llige H\u00fctten, eine steinerne Br\u00fccke mit Pranger und Turm, der Dorfplatz im Zentrum des Geschehens und ein Geh\u00f6ft zwischen Kornfeldern nahe dem Wald bilden die Kulisse f\u00fcr das bunte Treiben. In der Ferne erstreckt sich das offene Meer, \u00fcberstrahlt von der leuchtenden Sonne eines sp\u00e4tsommerlichen Tages. Durch die subtile Farbgebung sind die verschiedenen Szenen miteinander verkn\u00fcpft. Kr\u00e4ftige Rot- und Blaut\u00f6ne bilden dabei die Angelpunkte der Komposition. Im Zentrum der Darstellung dominiert das Blau des Mantels, den eine junge Frau in leuchtendrotem Kleid ihrem alten, hinf\u00e4lligen Mann umh\u00e4ngt. Von dem Motiv des blauen Mantels, einem gel\u00e4ufigen Sinnbild des Betruges, leitet sich eine der alten Benennungen des Bildes ab. Dieselbe Bezeichnung findet sich auch auf einem 1558 in Antwerpen erschienenen Stich, der eine der Anregungen f\u00fcr Bruegels Bild geliefert haben d\u00fcrfte. In der Beischrift des Stiches hei\u00dft es: \u00bbDer blaue Mantel wird dies meist genannt, doch als die Torheiten der Welt w\u00e4re es besser bekannt.\u00ab Die Vorstellung, da\u00df Torheit und Selbstbetrug am Anfang allen Ungl\u00fccks stehen, hatte in Erasmus von Rotterdams \u00bbLob der Torheit\u00ab (1511) greifbaren Ausdruck erlangt. Die andere alte Benennung unseres Bildes als Verkehrte Welt geht auf das Motiv der auf den Kopf gestellten Weltkugel zur\u00fcck, die Bruegel als auffallendes Wahrzeichen am links im Bild wiedergegebenen Haus darstellte. Dieses Sinnbild macht deutlich, da\u00df wir uns in einer verkehrten Welt befinden. Die Menschen, das hei\u00dft die Bildfiguren Bruegels, sind dabei wohl als typische Vertreter der einzelnen St\u00e4nde, nicht jedoch als Individuen charakterisiert. Gleich seelenlosen Marionetten bewegen sie sich auf der B\u00fchne, ohne an ihrer Umgebung Anteil zu nehmen. Es ist ein Schauspiel, dessen Inszenierung an die von Rabelais 1564 geschilderte Reise des Pantagruel ins Reich der Quintessenz erinnert, deren Untertanen in ihrem wunderlichen Treiben sprichw\u00f6rtliche Absurdit\u00e4ten verk\u00f6rpern. Die Schilderung der Ungereimtheit, Sinnwidrigkeit und Narretei im Verhalten der Menschen nimmt auch in der Darstellung Bruegels unter dem Leitmotiv der verkehrten Welt breiten Raum ein. Da wird der Brunnen zugesch\u00fcttet, nachdem das Kalb ertrunken ist, oder das Licht mit K\u00f6rben an den Tag getragen. Andere Sprichw\u00f6rter enthalten Anspielungen auf die Tods\u00fcnden. Betrug, L\u00fcge und Heuchelei geh\u00f6ren zu weiteren negativen Eigenschaften der Menschen, die durch die Sprichw\u00f6rter nachdr\u00fccklich belegt werden. Es ist eine Welt, in der man nicht Gott, sondern dem Teufel dient. Selbst die Vertreter des geistlichen Standes bilden da keine Ausnahme, wenn sie dem Herrgott einen Bart aus Flachs umh\u00e4ngen. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird deutlich, da\u00df Bruegels Bild in Wahrheit eine scharfe Kritik enth\u00e4lt und dabei pessimistisch gestimmt ist. Dennoch handelt es sich um mehr als eine blo\u00dfe Darlegung des als unab\u00e4nderlich empfundenen Schauspiels menschlichen Treibens. Bruegel hat vielmehr die Menschen seiner Zeit in die Lage versetzen wollen, die Sinnwidrigkeit ihres Handelns zu erkennen und in ihrer ganzen Tragweite zu begreifen. In dieser Hinsicht hat seine Botschaft auch heute kaum etwas von ihrer Aktualit\u00e4t verloren. | Rainald GrosshansSIGNATUR / INSCHRIFT: Bez. rechts unten: BRVEGEL \u2022 155"}, {"title": "Melencolia I", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_SXmMhFXuYqmJU94k14dJCXc0asu-4Sf0GyY-gqHhgKfsNBjbaalzxzfHoqHri4GpVxxIk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Melencolia I", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_DSE4hyeyIEoXjxCJQEWhYplgz4219WBpNWMbcvytNXRRTLwgUDHwGdFCFzWuDmCHC9S4b", "desc": null}, {"title": "The adolescent Bacchus", "artist": "Caravaggio Merisi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM84SdWAquQlGSZ93w7hsxH1ppeJuVE1PKzsGsScJa83w1hg-pZf5yUr1spKSvA1MLL0KpT0tA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Battle of the Centaurs", "artist": "Michelangelo Buonarroti", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9BzhpXx-TEWKmAjpip8JNY7n1A4iiy2v2_4YX2T2fI6bBaz65jMaf_-EhLgFEbAZaHj0eo3h4", "desc": "While Condivi\u2019s biography states that the Battle of the Centaurs was executed for Lorenzo the Magnificent, on a theme suggested by Politian, Giorgio Vasari includes the Battle in his description of the Garden of San Marco, the piece of land owned by the Magnificent and facing onto Piazza San Marco in Florence, which was a celebrated training ground for a number of young artists, including the adolescent Michelangelo.

In 1518, in a completely different context, he had the opportunity of making a charcoal drawing of the aging Habsburg emperor during the imperial diet at Augsburg. The study (Vienna, Albertina) was the model for a painted portrait, which may have been commissioned by Jakob Fugger, who founded Augsburg\u2019s Fuggerei (the world\u2019soldest social settlement) and the Fugger trading company. D\u00fcrer portrays the emperor as an elegant private gentleman. Here the painter adopted an existing type in the tradition of Habsburg portraits but combined it with incomparable mastery of the demands of the state portrait. The emperor is not wearing the outward signs of his high rank; even the otherwise obligatory neck chain of the Order of the Golden Fleece is not worn on the emperor\u2019s body but appears at the upper left in the background. Instead, the desired impression of power and dignity is provided by the way the emperor fills the frame, the precious fabrics and the brilliantly painted fur collar, Timelessness and distance are suggested by the monochrome background. The monumentality of Maximilian\u2019s physical appearance has imperial character; the precise depiction of quiet melancholy and fatigue on his face in no way diminishes the extraordinary importance of the subject. Several interpretations have been proposed for the pomegranate in his hand, all of which may be correct: it may be a private replacement for the imperial orb, a reference to the myth of Persephone and thus to the fact that Maximilian had already died, and/or an allusion to the conquest of Granada by Christian armies in 1492."}, {"title": "Four Naked Women", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8JMPN2rwM1Q7fzB0LIPDe6Huvs-SToAlGw75PAFssNLS9Y62LCyN4hcLl95UiEnfm-So6wgsPu", "desc": null}, {"title": "Samson Slaying a Philistine", "artist": " http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O14761", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9o5q_MytrT9oAZ_djnHljI-tj4YxNj3Q_k8JNeYrgjceAB0UMDQrZPck1DDyEGXcYOmS-EaEWy", "desc": null}, {"title": "Flora", "artist": "Tiziano Vecellio", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8G7QQJ-GXn58azTswg4tyVCJDy7d8b4krAkHjVG2s4dvffzQtZWmujWBmTxBlaDJg4ufimdGHI", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Crucifixion; The Last Judgment", "artist": "Jan van Eyck", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9i-ktwz4rvDyrvkgtWU8d1v6G5N6wzak09tfrbUlS3cVLd6qN51UPCu7uEJ6j0vuQdoguOYQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "St. Francis in the Desert", "artist": "Giovanni Bellini", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9oXuDvTMm6imrDo9Bhe6ZqvtwGEEBoKs1Vpmuaa00q3nS4qYX5J78mB6YV10fExv38R9GKbA", "desc": "Many a nonbeliever has been struck dumb by the spiritual force of this painting, which may well be Giovanni Bellinis masterpiece, one of the finest works in The Frick Collection, and possibly the greatest Renaissance painting in America.

His major inspiration was drawn however directly from nature, which is evident in artworks like Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (1558) or Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap (1565). Although the Italianate style dominated in his times, Bruegel the Elder preferred a somewhat simpler form. He was the pioneer of Netherlandish genre painting because his main focus lay on village life, as seen, for instance, in Netherlandish Proverbs (1559).

The artist also drew upon his experience of the exceptionally severe winter of 1564-5 to describe a village covered in snow, with icicles hanging from the rooftops and the pond in the foreground thickly frozen over. Bruegels Massacre of the Innocents was a popular image, repeated numerous times mainly by the artist and by his son, Pieter Bruegel the Younger. Shortly after its creation the painting came into the possession of the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II, in Prague. The slaughtered babies were painted over with details such as bundles, food and animals so that, instead of a massacre, it appeared to be a more general scene of plunder. The biographer, Karel van Mander, described it as a Massacre in 1604; it had become a village plundering when recorded in an inventory of 1621. The shadow of the infants can be seen underneath the over-painted areas. The flames added in the sky over the houses were cleaned off in 1941, but it was decided during its full conservation treatment in 1988 to leave the more substantial (and historically significant) alterations to the figures, where animals and inanimate objects are painted over the details of children being slaughtered. The painting is a unique example of multiple narrative. Bruegels painting requires us to read each episode one by one. In the background, immediately below the church, a father tries to smuggle his baby to safety, though the mounted soldier on the bridge behind and the many horses tethered (their riders presumably searching houses) suggest that he is unlikely to succeed. In the left background a soldier urinates against a wall. A soldier herds women into a house at the extreme left; another soldier carries a baby (one of the few that have not been changed) out of a nearer door, while against the wall of the same house some neighbours seem to be consoling a grieving mother. Moving to the right, a standing woman grieves over her dead baby lying in the snow (changed to an array of hams and cheeses); a couple seem to beg a soldier to take their daughter rather than kill their baby son (changed to a goose or swan); a huddle of villagers console or restrain a father who might otherwise attack the Lansquenet (German mercenary) in striped hose who guards a dead baby (changed to a bundle). A seated woman grieves with her dead baby (changed to a bundle) on her lap. A group of soldiers stab with pikes at a pile of babies (changed to livestock) to ensure that they are all dead; women run off in horror as another Lansquenet stabs a baby (changed to a young boar); a soldier stabs at a baby (changed to a pitcher) cradled by a seated woman. At this point a distinct group forms as ugly and ridiculous-looking villagers remonstrate with a young, elegantly-dressed herald who originally had the symbol of the Habsburg eagle on his tabard (overpainted with a simple decoration). At the extreme right soldiers are forcing entry to an inn: one wields an axe and one a battering ram, three climb in at the shutters, one kicks down a courtyard door, thereby dislodging an icicle that will fall on his head like divine vengeance. Reading across the foreground right to left we see a baby (changed to a bundle) torn from a mother and her daughter. Two generations of a family grieve for a baby about to be stabbed (changed to a calf). At the left foreground another sergeant pursues a fleeing mother and child, a group not painted over though partly lost when this side of the panel was cut down at some point in the paintings history. The troop of armoured knights is led by a man, whose features have been altered. In the other versions of this painting he has the distinctive drooping eyes and long beard of the Duke of Alva, who harshly ruled the Netherlands for Philip II of Spain from 1567-73. Before it was painted over, the standard held by one of these soldiers displayed five gold crosses on a white ground - the arms of Jerusalem, which were sometimes used as an emblem of Philip II of Spain"}, {"title": "Knight, Death, and the Devil", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_NgQFLoEMjMIcsD93p6C0LHO9E3UBlETpExgV-cXrAKr1DiNM4pVjZ4vw3T59jrYA8RCzOU-w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Die Hexe", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM94HSIIzYTBiQ4LKH6dDT0NM1n0eP28p9VUitpFvRQFSu_NBjORL9P1iE4g50wmzpLKKjAjtfWx", "desc": "Um 1500 schuf D\u00fcrer einen kleinformatigen Kupferstich, der unter dem Titel \"Die Hexe\" bekannt ist.

In 100 canti, divided into three parts, this epic poem (written during the first twenty years of the 14th century) is a highly imaginative and allegorical vision of the universe. The reader experiences it by following the poet on a journey through the three realms of afterlife starting from the depths of sin in the Inferno (Hell), through the arduous ascent of purification in the Purgatorio (Mount of the Purgatory) to eternal serenity in the Paradiso (Heaven), a passage which also represents the soul\u00b4s journey towards God. At end of the 15th century, i. e. almost 200 years after Dante wrote the Divine Comedy, Sandro Botticelli, one of the most famous and celebrated artists of the Renaissance in Florence, undertook the ambitious mission to entirely visualize this poetic vision of the universe. The result is this truly outstanding cycle of drawings, which consisted originally in 102 sheets, of which 85 are conserved in the Kupferstichkabinett - Museum of Prints, Drawings & Fine Manuscripts in Berlin today. These unique drawings bear witness to a veritable competition or dialogue, in which draughtsman and poet engage to explore the limits and the power of word and image. Botticelli\u00b4s drawings exceed the traditional form of book illustration or miniature by far. Apparently they are based on a totally new, personal and intense preoccupation of the artist with the work of the poet, which was doubtless inspired by the humanistic ambience of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de\u00b4Medici for whom the artist created these drawings and also some of his most famous paintings"}, {"title": "The Honourable Mrs Graham (1757 - 1792)", "artist": "Thomas Gainsborough", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Q13KAJb4HrYaOVh8b_prwY3lw_PbEDsPxPiuPVaQekxqn9TFtWdg_PprLttbbyRlR-tc2", "desc": null}, {"title": "Drunken Silenus", "artist": "Jusepe de Ribera", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8zA4apj7cGwwUW8L1UdFqPTzrZ9oE4dW7h_g4RD-G3PtO9A9tZovLC_H8p76Gxj1AtiBbGY9o", "desc": null}, {"title": "View and Plan of Toledo", "artist": "El Greco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9IqXS-Z0z9fKSWpKmxcqp8n1HbCsZC0hcRyZDFq3Y0xq8T8iUK0MdGCv1OnM8fQ7rsbeMBgHE", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Annunciation", "artist": " National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_YodrMCQCN6gu6JOdQ6McfuCWCINR-VPwNFJOTqJWNEpaS2xazdmRZsq3x5eLDD-1YUIvospA", "desc": "The Annunciation described by Saint Luke is interpreted in terms of actuality in this painting, which was probably once the left wing of a triptych.

It first came to England after his death and in the mid-17th century was finally purchased for Archduke Leopold Wilhelm\u2019s Brussels collection.

Are the three figures the Three Kings, astronomers, representatives of three religions or the rival exponents of painting, philosophy and astrology? Recently, Pythagoras and his two teachers, Thales und Pherecydes, have also been mentioned. The features usually cited in these varied interpretations are the compasses and the square, which the seated and youngest of the three men is holding in his hands and which are seen as attributes of a painter (?), the varied origins of the three figures\u2019 attire and the astronomical writings held on the far right by the eldest of the three men.

Correggio painted the commonest of the various versions of the ancient myth: Jupiter approached Leda on the banks of the river Eurota in the guise of a swan and seduced her. Leda and the swan can be seen on the bank in front of a clump of trees, on the left are two amoretti with wind instruments and a boyish Cupid with his lyre. lt is uncertain whether the figures on the right are Ledas companions or a simultaneous presentation of other scenes from the story. Three other pictures from the cycle have survived as well as the \"Leda\": the painting of the \"Dan\u00e4e\" in Rome, and also the \"Abduction of Ganymede\" and \"Io\", both in Vienna. Egon Verheyen has suggested that the pictures were intended to decorate a hall in the Palazzo del T\u00e8, the Dukes summer residence. The hall was part of an \"appartamento\" that may have been intended for Isabella Boschetti, the Dukes official mistress. The cycle found its way to Spain and into the possession of Philip II, presumably after the death of Federico II. The Berlin picture passed through famous collections in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries and came into the possession of Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans, the Regent of France, in 1721. His son Louis found the portrayal of Leda offensive, and cut the painting to pieces in an attack of religious frenzy, destroying the head of Leda.

From a sketched view of Reggio Calabria in the museum\u2019s collection, we can deduce that Bruegel travelled to the far south of the country.

The sandy hair of the unknown woman is held at the back of the head by a shining golden net, the prevailing fashion in Venice. D\u00fcrer has used carefully distributed highlights to emphasise the curly hair falling to either side of the face; it has a formal counterpart in the fine ribbons of her dress. The fact that D\u00fcrer left the preparatory underdrawing of the ribbon on the left has led to the assumption that the picture is unfinished, but technical analysis of the entire surface of the painting speaks against it. It makes sense from a compositional point of view: the colour of the one ribbon matches the woman\u2019s hair, while the other picks up the monochrome tone of the background and is also found in the young woman\u2019s dark eyes. D\u00fcrer arrived in Venice in the late autumn of 1505. This portrait is believed to be the first work he painted there. In addition to his adoption of the typical composition of Venetian portraits, the refreshing influence of D\u00fcrer\u2019s new environment is also seen in his suppression of details in favour of a comprehensive view of the whole. Compared with works that he painted in the north, D\u00fcrer altered the character of the light, which appears gentle and unifying instead of brightly illuminating every contour. Anticipating his return to the north in January 1507, D\u00fcrer wrote to his friend Willibald Pirckheimer a lament that has become famous: \u201cO wy wirt mich noch der sunnen friren.

It was plundered by Napoleon\u2019s troops during the Italian campaign and taken to the Louvre in 1798. It was never given back to its rightful owner, the Italian church, also because of difficulty in transportation. This work is in many ways spectacular. It was commissioned by the marquise Francesco Gonzaga and by his wife Isabella d\u2019Este. It is basically an ex voto with which the ruler of Mantua wanted to thank God for having survived the Fornovo battle, fought July 6, 1495, by the French army and the armies of the Holy League, formed by the Pope, Ludovico Sforza of Milan and the city of Venice, the Italian army led by Francesco. Although the battle ended in a draw, it managed to temporarily halt the invasion of the Italian peninsula. The painting is characterized by the monumentality typical of the late Mantegna. It is composed by a piramidal construction at the apex of which is the Virgin Mary, surrounded by four saint warriors, Saint Andrew, Saint Michael, Saint Longinus and Saint George, by Francesco himself and by an elderly female figure who might be Elisabeth, or perhaps the Blessed Osanna Andreasi. The Virgin Mary, baby Jesus and Saint John are on a precious piedestal on which a scene depicting the temptation of Adam and Eve is visible.

The fountain brings forth the water, into which Cupid dips his arrows or from which lovers drink and fall in love. In nearly every period, artists have painted this romantic motif. During the 1700s, artists came to treat the Fountain of Love almost as a genre subject, with lovers in contemporary dress flirting in a garden around a decorative fountain.

This inner fire seems to be reflected in the tense colour of his dark red cloak. Peter, on the other hand, is passive and gentle. His pose, the somewhat weak gesture of his hands, the tilted head and sad, incomprehending gaze - all speak of a tender nature. Before us are two striking but contrasting individuals.  Outwardly, however, they are not so different. El Greco emphasises the common elements in the faces of his heroes, their ascetic nature, and the two saints seem somehow reminiscent of figures on icons. The heavy folds of their cloaks do more to hide than to reveal the figures beneath and it seems as though earthly flesh is dissolving in a mass of fabric. Light slides across the figures and flickers in the colour, reinforcing the impression of unearthliness. The physical world would seem to be retreating in the face of the spiritual.

The gently smiling face of the Madonna derives from the Netherlandish tradition, but the posture of the child, his body twisted on its axis, can be found in the early Italian Renaissance. Also of Italian origin is the powerful corporeality of the infant Jesus, which D\u00fcrer generously characterises with soft shadows. In his left hand the infant holds the upper end of a pear, which was considered a symbol of virginity. During his second stay in Venice (1505\u20131507) D\u00fcrer had to a certain degree internalised the ideals of Venetian painting. There is a greater emphasis on painterly rather than graphic representation, and individual details are omitted infavour of the overall impression. The Virgin and Child with a Pear was created during a phase of upheaval in D\u00fcrer\u2019s work: between 1513 and 1516, D\u00fcrerturned away from painting for a considerable period, creating important graphic works instead. Shortly before this period began, however, he completed another commissioned painting: he created two idealised portraits, Charlemagne and Emperor Sigismund, to decorate a room in Nuremberg\u2019s \u201cSchoppenhaus\u201d, where the imperial regalia were stored before being displayed at the Feast of the Holy Lance, which was celebrated just after Easter.

Yet Charles was not a particularly attractive man, as attested to by contemporary accounts: His lower jaw is unwieldy and protrudes, as if it were not a natural part of him, but some additional imitation; and so if he closes his mouth, a space the size of a row of teeth is left between the upper and lower teeth. One of Charless first portraitists was Barend van Orley in Brussels. This image was made about the time the adolescent young man had been elected (at the cost of enormous bribes) Holy Roman Emperor. However, there is no reference here to this title or to the Spanish throne he had inherited earlier; only the royal emblem of Burgundy, the flint and steel, appears on the large hat brooch, between the large doubled initial of his name, and around his neck hangs the badge of the famous order of the golden fleece.

The Venetian collector Andrea Odoni (1488-1545) holds in one hand a statuette of Diana of Ephesus, symbol of nature, and with the other he clasps a cross to his chest, suggesting that Christianity takes precedence over nature and the pagan gods of antiquity. Lotto had recently returned to Venice after thirteen years in Bergamo and was anxious to impress possible patrons in Venice. The portrait has aptly been described as one of the finest and most ambitious of all of Lottos portraits and a deliberate challenge to Titians supremacy in the field. The portrait was recorded in the owners bedroom in his house on the Fondamenta del Gaffero by Marcantonio Michiel when he visited the collection in 1532. Giorgio Vasari mentions the portrait che \u00e8 molto bello, which he must have seen when he visited Venice ten years later. The painting was also included in the 1555 inventory of his brother and heir, Alvise Odoni. The son of a wealthy recent Milanese immigrant to the city, Andrea Odoni was an important member of the cittadini. He built upon the collection which he had inherited from his uncle, Francesco Zio, to become a renowned collector of paintings, sculpture, antique vases, coins, gems and natural history specimens. This portrait was hung in Odonis bedroom alongside religious and profane paintings: a reclining nude by Savoldo, and paintings by Palma Vecchio and Titian (possibly The Virgin and Child with the Infant St John and a Female Saint or Donor, now in the National Gallery, London). The house also contained an unusual combination of ancient and modern statuary, with mutilated and lacerated antique marble heads and other figures. Pietro Aretino (the poet and satirist) wrote to Odoni (in a letter of 1538) that he had re-created Rome in Venice, though elsewhere he describes the splendours of the house in a tone that suggests it overstepped the boundaries of Venetian decorum. Giorgio Vasari called Odonis house a friendly haven for men of talent. Most of the sculpture in the present painting has been identified as versions, probably plaster casts, of well-known originals. There are three representations of Hercules: Hercules and Antaeus; the standing figure with a lion skin identified at the time as Emperor Commodus as Hercules; and Hercules Mingens on the far right. There are two representations of Venus: the torso in the foreground (possibly Venus Victrix), and a Bathing Venus. In the foreground there is also a cast of the bust of Hadrian (Museo Nazionale, Naples). Odoni holds out statuette of Diana or Artemis of the Ephesians in his right hand. Of these only Hadrians bust is known to have been in Odonis collection, as it appears in his brother Alvise Odonis inventory. It has been suggested that the others were not in Odonis collection, but rather belonged to Lotto: we know from Lottos wills and account book that he owned plaster and wax reliefs and sculpture in gesso. The fragments must have been included in the painting because they were important to Odoni, or as a symbolic commentary on him. Although the originals from which they were copied are likely to have been fragments, their battered state seems to have been emphasised by Lotto and their arrangement challenging and ironic, the Hercules Mingens placed facing the Bathing Venus, the torso of Venus in the foreground against the bust of Hadrian"}, {"title": "Triptic", "artist": "Andrea Mantegna", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_d8R8JWkygWj2myiKMtRhRyVbDUUfwQ3Na1lR2QzutecIObh2LYkeQvi8kEdbqAXDifyo7ra8", "desc": null}, {"title": "Triptych: The Crucifixion", "artist": "Rogier van der Weyden", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8fCI9gS8mDStfq0L_Zh6rVM0o-buGVbL9OUIt9bmela1cAiCIxAt37v9EesKvV7Bd3sCgd", "desc": "Along with Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden dominated Netherlandish painting in Brussels in the first half of the 15th century, working both for the Burgundian court as well as for the urban patriciate. We know that in 1450 he undertook a pilgrimage to Rome. The Vienna painting, however, was created before this journey to Italy, which in the following century was to set the standard for artistic training. Today this Crucifixion scene is spread across a winged altar, but it was probably originally a single panel, with the \u201cframe\u201d only painted on to it. Not long after it was created, however, the work was sawn into three parts, making the portraits of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Veronica wings of a triptych. Given its original condition, it makes van der Weyden\u2019s artistic innovation even more significant: for the first time he unites all of the participants \u2013 the Crucifixion group, saints and the donors \u2013 in front of a continuous landscape, in which an idealised Jerusalem appears on the horizon. The realism of such a unified space had never been attempted in earlier works. Unknown today, the patrons are separated only by a conspicuous fissure in the ground from the central subject of religious contemplation, a concept that was so progressive that it was initially attenuated in the paintings of the period that followed. For along time afterwards, the donors, accompanied by their patron saints, were depicted on the wings of the altar. And there is a second innovation as well: Christ\u2019s loincloth, which seems to be blowing in the breeze.

In spite of being left unfinished (the Virgins face and the figures of the children remain in the underpainting phase), the Esterh\u00e1zy Madonna represents the most perfect moment even of this absolute art: the end of the Florentine years, before Raphael moved to Rome where he would move on and begin to deconstruct the harmony. It is still the season of synthesis, and as if the express intention was to pay hommage to his predecessors, the posture of the Madonna was developed from Leonardos paraphrase on an admired classical statue (the Crouching Venus). The pyramidal geometric structure, which masterfully directs the viewers attention to the scroll held by Saint John the Baptist, also derives from Leonardos ideas.

Satisfied with Sebastiano\u2019s work, the pope ordered this second version for his collection, to be painted on slate. The practice of painting on slate or stone is generally thought to have begun in Rome in the early 1500s. Sebastiano had begun experimenting with stone supports around 1530, and had come to favor it for certain important commissions because he believed that paintings on stone lasted longer than those on canvas or wood. His biographer Giorgio Vasari (1511\u20131574), in his Lives of 1550, asserted that \u201cpictures painted on slate last much longer than any other material.\u201d Pope Clement evidently shared Sebastianos enthusiasm for the support, which served to immortalize his portrait. Ironically, the stable, durable paint surface and lasting colors that could be achieved on slate were negated by the stone\u2019s inherent fragility\u2014especially during movement.

In 1483 he became official painter of the Republic of Venice, and together with his pupils Giorgione and Titian he was one of the founders of the Venetian High Renaissance. He viewed himself almost exclusively as a painter of religious subjects. There are only a few paintings by Bellini in which he deals with mythological themes, and his refusal to paint such a work for the Mantuan patron of the arts Isabella d\u2019Este is legendary. Thus the Vienna portrait of a young woman, which he painted in 1515, a year before his death, is such an exception. The nude figure is integrated into a system of horizontal and vertical features. She is sitting on a bench that has been covered with a precious carpet, and behind her is a dark-green surface on which a mirror has been hung. On the left a view of a Venetian landscape gives the painting depth. By using the same colours in the principal motif and landscape, Bellini connects the two spheres, and the basic mood of the painting is gentle and unified. In her right hand the young woman is holding another mirror, which is a symbol of vanitas on the one hand and an attribute of Venus Pudica on the other. Using the device of two mirrors, Bellini enables the observer to see two views of the woman\u2019s head from a single vantage point, a perspective possible only in painting. In addition, he thus enhances the independence of the woman\u2019s action from the view of the beholder \u2013 although the physical distance is very small. In his signature (\u201cJohannes bellinus faciebat M.D.X.V\u201d) on the small slip of paper on the right, Bellini is using a formulation by Apelles, considered the greatest painter of antiquity, and handed down by Pliny.

The Legenda Aurea (1265/66; Golden Legend) also tells about the impressive healing of Cromatius: the severely ill prefect had summoned Sebastian and Polycarpus, a Christian priest. They immediately baptised him and he was miraculously healed. To further support this new faith, Sebastian destroyed hundreds of idols in Cromatius\u2019s house. When Diocletian heard of it, he ordered the execution of Sebastian, who miraculously survived the archers\u2019 attempt to kill him with arrows. Diocletian then ordered that he be beaten to death with clubs. The saint has been venerated since the 7th century for his ability to turn away the plague. In the early 15th century, it became usual to depict Sebastian \u2013 both north and south of the Alps \u2013 as a naked youth clad onlyin a loin cloth. Mantegna, who was the most important Upper Italian painter of the Quattrocento, became court painter to the Gonzaga in Mantua in 1459. This is the first of his Sebastians and was probably painted a short time earlier in Padua. It documents his intensive study of ancient architecture and sculpture. The ability to depict a space in exact perspective was an accomplishment of the early Florentine Renaissance. The realism in this depiction of Sebastian\u2019s injuries and pain had seldom been found in such a clear and unmistakable form before. Perhaps the rider in the clouds at the above left is a reference to the transitoriness of human life. The archers have left the scene; three of them can be seen in the background at the left as they climb a curving path.

The English Queen took out the Queens [Mary, Queen of Scots] picture, and kissed it. It is possible Melville was referring to this miniature and that it subsequently remained in the Royal Collection. The manner in which Elizabeth I treated the miniature indicates the intimate use of such small-scale paintings. By the reign of Charles I the miniature was mounted in a frame with eight other miniature portraits of James Is ancestors. This exquisite miniature is related to a drawing by Fran\u00e7ois Clouet (c.1520-72) in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, Paris, but the drawing may be dated slightly earlier to c.1555. The clothing is updated in the miniature, in particular the detail of the ruff in the drawing which is changed into an open, standing collar. The drawing is only bust-length, whereas the miniature includes the sitters hands, perhaps indicating their significance to the function of this portrait. The gesture of placing a ring on the fourth finger of the right hand is thought to allude to the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots to the French Dauphin, the future Francis II, in 1558. This was standard symbolism for matrimony - for instance, on 13 August 1514, at the proxy marriage of Mary Tudor (Mary, Queen of Scots great-aunt) to Louis XII of France, the Princess is recorded having placed a gold ring on the fourth finger of her right hand. Mary, Queen of Scots had been betrothed to the Dauphin since the age of 5, and from that moment onwards was raised at the French court. This portrait would most likely have been commissioned by the French royal family from their court artist to commemorate the royal marriage. The jewel-like colours and contrasts of blue background and pink dress emphasise the Scots Queens renowned beauty, with sparkling hazel eyes and auburn hair. In a double portrait of Mary as Queen of France with Francis II, in the Livres dheures de Catherine de M\u00e9dicis (Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, Paris), Mary is crowned and her hands are joined in prayer.

His monumental altarpieces combined these ideas with local traditions, bringing the High Renaissance in Florence to its logical conclusion. Like his other work, this one, which Fra Bartolommeo painted for the church of his own monastery, combines symmetrical structure, monumental figures, graphic clarity alongside fluent painterly aspects, solemn gravity and quiet gestures. The temple interior is depicted in the central perspective typical of the Florentine manner, which creates a formal setting for the scene, viewed slightly from below. In his arms the elderly Simeon is holding the Christ Child, who has been brought to the temple by his parents. He recognises in Him the Messiah and turns towards Mary: \u201c[\u2026] Behold, this [child] is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thought of many hearts may be revealed.\u201d (Luke 2:34\u201335."}, {"title": "Eight Apostles", "artist": "Raphael", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9ZoYuXo4uWQGnAWc03tGT20AM9VKk__HbLx8UGUp_WinOzbwneK3k4vFO8I6nQUc7mhlScDd4", "desc": null}, {"title": "Madonna and Child with a Pomegranate", "artist": "Lorenzo di Credi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-_Se3PC2RgArX27YmtW_Mg6Xx6q8A01E7C516c4JbWqXkHSUkccTVwUn0rMJ_oDXKiRFVjHEs", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Michael Fighting the Dragon", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM85vYAxxlAFp-DrBXhGiNl5czc-izz3rFvt6vkeHf5WSezwv4z7nXfC-wb7VYlac_gZpyohZg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Judith with the Head of Holofernes", "artist": " National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8ishfYFgU5OqPwNtjeC-K-8fiZ5pS_b-0DWwRQvtRHPsMczWcXWDELwa5GZE1TRQXwqZQNQpQ9", "desc": "The story of Judith and Holofernes comes from the Old Testament Apocrypha, sacred texts that were excluded from the Bible.

His date of birth is generally accepted as 1472, but little is known about his biography and work before his appointment 33 years later as court painter in Wittenberg. He is known to have lived in Vienna as early as 1498, where he was in close contact with Humanists at the university, and these connections may have led to his appointment by the elector Frederick the Wise. First mentioned in the inventory of Vienna\u2019s Abbey of the Scots in 1800, the present Crucifixion is the first work that can be clearly attributed to the painter. It is conspicuously different from the works he was to create in Wittenberg only a short time later. Here Cranach sticks to a symmetrically arranged Crucifixion group of the traditional type but \u201cdramatises\u201d the scene by creating formal equality between the human figures and their vegetal surroundings. Nervous brush strokes are juxtaposed to soft outlines; detailed coloration and balanced lighting create a unified impression in the final image. In its delineation, the unusually dear depiction of the tortured body of Christ corresponds with parts of the vegetation in the background. Because of these characteristics, the present painting is regarded as a forerunner of the so-called Danube school of painting, of which Albrecht Altdorfer became the most prominent exponent. The painting probably also includes a reference to Cranach\u2019s earlier stay in Poland: it has recently been suggested that the attire of the group at the right is that of Polish-Lithuanian horsemen."}, {"title": "Portrait Charles V", "artist": "Bernard van Orley", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_miR3Fk8rFOxLKpu8HY1U88xjSwH6k196JAZ60E68kDkOmIKgQRCZPtqXW1dqAJLl-Bdud", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Werner", "artist": "Master of Messkirch", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_9s5g55ME_Mnnyp_VumcULKVkHfxrdRRNWgtFYhtNZdR1nOZ3yGH-Oqvg06T29Yn1wDXBA4bw", "desc": "This small panel shows St Werner engrossed in a book.

This has led to the supposition that the two panels were painted at different points in time, rather far apart from one another. Goes, in his striking rendition of the \u201ctempter\u201d with the head of a woman, body of a salamander and feet of an aquatic bird, was falling back on an existing tradition that was occasionally found in Netherlandish (book) paintings. The work is mentioned in 1659 in the inventory of the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm but attributed in error to Jan van Eyck. Later all knowledge was lost that the two panels of the diptych, which had meanwhile been separated, belonged together. The former outside panel has also been preserved (KHM, GG, Inv. No. 5822 B). They were not presented together again until 1884 and 1887, by that time attributed to van der Goes. Initially, Hugo van der Goes worked primarily in Ghent. His involvement in the decorations for the wedding of Charles the Bold of Burgundy to Margaret of York in Bruges in 1468, however, brought him more widespread fame, awakening the interest of the archduke and later emperor Maximilian. The latter visited the painter in 1477 during a stay in Ghent and Brussels on the occasion of his marriage to Mary of Burgundy.

Beuckelaer based his work on such earlier examples but used a sketch-like brushwork not found in 15th-century Netherlandish painting, and thus gave his painting a sense of vivid movement. This type of rough brushwork is frequently seen in small-scale works for private individuals, and it can be considered a means of responding to high demand for such works. However, the central figures, whether Christ or the Madonna, are shown in careful finish, clearly an intentional difference from the surrounding sketchy depiction.

Hans Holbein was born in Augsburg, trained in Basel and spent a total of thirteen years in England, in 1526-8 and 1532-43. During the latter period he was the most important artist at the court of Henry VIII, though the English were primarily interested in portraits of themselves - as Anthony Van Dyck was to find a century later - and little survives of Holbeins more varied works in England (such as the lost Triumphs of Riches and Poverty for the Hanseatic merchants hall). The bulk of the eighty-five portrait drawings now at Windsor were probably in Holbeins studio at his death. They were first documented in 1547 in an album owned by Edward VI, subsequently leaving and re-entering the Royal Collection twice before 1675, with a few losses and additions along the way. About thirty of the drawings can be connected with surviving paintings, and nearly all the remainder were no doubt studies for lost works. In most cases the identity of the sitter is known only from the inscriptions on the drawings, copied - probably in the 18th century - from identifications reputedly made by Sir John Cheke, tutor to Edward VI.Holbein arrived in England in late 1526 with a letter of introduction from Erasmus, addressed to Sir Thomas More (1478 - 1535), then Speaker of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (he was to be appointed Lord Chancellor in 1529). Erasmus and More had been friends and correspondents for many years, part of a close international circle of humanist scholars that also included the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Warham. A portrait of Erasmus painted by Holbein in 1523 had been sent as a gift to Warham, and the artists abilities would therefore have been known to More before his arrival in England. Holbein probably lodged in Mores house in Chelsea throughout his first English sojourn; guild regulations obliged foreign craftsmen to live and work outside the City of London. The major work of Holbeins first period in England was a portrait of the family of Thomas More, and though this study corresponds with the depiction of More in that painting, it was probably not directly preparatory for it. There are two studies of More at Windsor, both significantly larger in scale than the other six surviving head studies connected with the family group. Both are also close in their details and scale to a portrait of More alone, dated 1527, and it is likely that the studies of Thomas More were drawn in preparation for the single portrait, executed to Mores satisfaction before he commissioned the artist to attempt the much more ambitious family group"}, {"title": "13A Study of a fortification for the Porta al Prato of Ognissanti", "artist": "Michelangelo Buonarroti", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_fYH_eVBCCaOBfH-P2csXScVAM7Brf9fKhcnmxJ3dXOCaagLIQpIqlz2Bewtp_jVxNHDL_KA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Mars, Venus and Cupid", "artist": "Paolo Veronese", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-B5HQb6yC3x94cTQ-W1AuuwU6s3m0rJ5pK96Mhu0q2-tst-s6vhcF1ZWwcbNKaInzqsXHDco4", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Martyrdom of Saint Andrew", "artist": "Jusepe de Ribera", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8ZUyTVFi9-XmYeTHQwW8PDFlllpSbMOnOTRIgBec9xGGgGZthiumazEqWrTrKugDvu6Xi97JDj", "desc": "Seventeenth-century Naples was, according to many, hell upon earth.

It was perhaps inevitable that Caravaggios violent art, which grappled with the fear of death, came into its own in Naples, and for decades it set the way for the citys painters.But the school of ruthless naturalism did not reach its peak until a generation later, with Ribera. This Spanish-born master was most in his element when portraying the tortuous deaths of Christian martyrs, with shocking verisimilitude, as in this masterpiece of his darkest period. The apostle Andrew preached the gospel in the East, until Roman governor of Achaea condemned him to follow the founder of his \"superstitious sect\" in death by crucifixion. If anybody, it is Ribera who manages to convince us that for Andrew martyrdom was redemption. His humiliated body is shrivelled by time, his withered skin hangs drily from his frame; and yet there emanates from him a metaphysical power of the soul. Over him tower shadows of a priest and the governor, presaging Goyas oppressive demons.

Spirito. The original frame by Giuliano da Sangallo was probably lost when the picture, which stayed in the Bardi family until 1825, was replaced by a more modern painting only a hundred years after its installation. A copy of a similar period frame in S. Spirito was created for this work in 1978. The subject matter, the enthroned Madonna with saints standing at her side, originates with Fra Angelico, and it was the theme of several other altar paintings (done at the same time or slightly earlier) in S. Spirito. Here the saints are the two St. Johns, with John the Baptist in the place of honour as patron saint. Botticelli moves away from the other works mentioned by reducing the architectural constructs and making the baldacchino behind Mary entirely of palm fronds. Foliage niches allude to the earlier, tripartite retable type. The composition is dominated by the over-lavish plant decoration, even though the countless texts (mainly from Jesus Sirach), make it clear that it has a very specific iconographical purpose. This tension between precise observation of nature and an elaborate concept is well served by elements that play down the distance from the viewer: the eyes of John the Baptist and the Christ Child, the placing of the saints on the step leading into the image or the small crucifix on the altar, which we imagine to be beneath the painting"}, {"title": "A Cat Stealing Fish", "artist": "Giuseppe Recco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM91AsSZryzKrpC5N4BxHf1a2yof5_9pKdrHuPDWMaq-qNR5AZ2syq8AE6zPszgYTxQPl6t6twM", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Seven-Headed Beast and the Beast with Lamb's Horns", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-yGrOejWPV0Kr6mfhO9EEtNCwJ6iTvKGpmdQNZ4GdDbCNT9U_pIw3rt8bkgk7T5lPTK0jqM2hW", "desc": null}, {"title": "Marguerite of France, Queen of Navarre", "artist": "Fran\u00e7ois Clouet", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9cDBjxwfCjbiuG6ytTMGwWf2keGODxWIIX-dLtizsN9AWbwrgtfycYYkt1OMAxUr1gWX2IDs0i", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Apollo Belvedere from the Vatican his left hand resting on the tree trunk around which coils a python", "artist": "Marcantonio Raimondi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_ob_xZ-oWlXvVWh84UpEw29IuKLDoBzRMJAGxdf4ZEH9er6DPARWAoyzYdpAi_yMv02I42cbE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Young Woman (\u201cLaura\u201d)", "artist": "Giorgione", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-YhnRxHTXqV_2wuDu69lzvKx0GN_6jqBCr41zZfnutbSsMSFxeRpT95FHVHeMDWbENb2is", "desc": "\u201c[\u2026] on 1 June 1506, this was made by the hand of the master Giorgio da Castelfranco, the colleague of master Vincenzo Catena, at the instigation of Mr. Giacomo.\u201d This inscription on the back of the painting, translated here from the Italian, gives us one of our few fixed points in the life and work of Giorgione. The half-length portrait depicts a young woman in a fur-trimmed red cloak. Muted colouring and the fine Venetian shading of sfumato, actually adopted from Leonardo, combine with the sensual character of the subject to produce a convincing unity. A white veil is wrapped across the young woman\u2019s coiffured hair and falls in a gentle arc over the soft skin of her upper body. Right behind her, set off against a dark background, rises a vigorous laurel-tree (Italian: lauro). It may be intended as a coded reference to the subject\u2019s name but could also bean attribute of poetry, a symbol of the wish for fidelity in marriage or a reference to Daphne \u2013 all of these interpretations are possible. And yet another possibility has also been discussed, one that has to do with the ambiguity in the position of her hand and the character of her clothing. The winter clothing of wealthy Venetian courtesans was usually a beautiful garment lined with fur. Is the young woman closing her cloak or is she about to let it fall?

In 1961 Federico Zeri attempted a reconstruction of the original altarpiece and indicated that there are three other panels extant of the same size, format and background that are thought to be part of the same altarpiece (St. Lawrence, Thyssen collection, Madrid; St. Ambrose, the Office for National Art Property, The Hague, and St. John the Baptist, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). While there is no specific evidence to support his claim, Zeri believes that these four works were part of the altarpiece for S. Lorenzo of Castel San Pietro, described in records in which Crivelli is said to have received the deposit for the work in 1487. The figural type seen here corresponds to those of many of the sainted bishops he depicted (such as St. Augustine, Colonna Gallery, Rome), and it is possible that the dullness of the depicted line could speak of the intervention of his disciples.\tThis work passed from the Butler collection of London to the hands of Matsukata Kojiro, and was brought to Japan prior to World War II. The painting was displayed in the 3rd Matsukata Collection exhibition held in 1930 as the work of Vittore Crivelli, Carlos younger brother.

The present portrait of Don Carlos (1545\u20131568), the only son of Philip II and his first wife (and cousin), Mary of Portugal, was commissioned by Emperor Maximilian II and finished in 1564. Because marriage was planned between Maximilian\u2019s daughter Anna and Don Carlos, her second cousin, the portrait was sent soon after its creation to the Vienna court. The chosen bridegroom, however, was mentally and physically handicapped. A crooked back and a shortened leg restricted his movements, and he was prone to violent outbursts of rage. A head injury resulting from a fall in 1562 had made the situation considerably worse. In 1568 his father finally ordered his arrest. The infant responded with hunger strikes, and his condition deteriorated rapidly. Four months later Don Carlos died. Rumours were spread by the political opponents of the king that he had poisoned his defiant son but these were probably just propaganda. In any case, the heroically depicted protagonist in Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos, Infant of Spain (1787) and Verdi\u2019s Don Carlo (1867) has little in common with the historical person. The painter masterfully disguised the unfavourable physical condition of the potential bridegroom: depicted in the standardised posture characteristic of the full-length court portrait, Don Carlos is turned slightly to the side, making the different length of his legs appear balanced, and the distortion of his torso is hidden underneath the dark cape thrown over his shoulders. Viewers are kept at a distance by the cool coloration and matt surfaces."}, {"title": "Saint George Standing", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_4wFnJZ9GJ-2b6N1RKYr34K7uRRPhTFArxszeaAcNqHzgkMLmghn52Wk5mZdLhNJfqhntm", "desc": null}, {"title": "Elisabeth d'Autriche (1554-1592) reine de France", "artist": "Fran\u00e7ois Clouet", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-_2QQq32XEWuVFVte-_Dsq5lFBPHgcIm2o_6Uy_T6qp1-5ILLvyYnSHW5M9j43GJ8PnZ2C_dkX", "desc": null}, {"title": "San Pedro en penitencia", "artist": "Jos\u00e9 de Ribera, el Espa\u00f1oleto", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-OnbrHiNPKy3_Od6P7HU8-yrfRZOh8QwWF3-W7PJYrAXMchceR-Y4uSlcsUe7ZI3FBVbTYu2s", "desc": "El Barroco de Jos\u00e9 de Ribera bebi\u00f3 del car\u00e1cter tenebrista de su primer maestro, Francisco Ribalta, pero su permanencia en N\u00e1poles tambi\u00e9n lo acerc\u00f3 a la pintura de Michelangelo Merisi, il Caravaggio (1571-1610).En este expresivo san Pedro, de un fondo oscuro emerge la figura con gran austeridad.El rostro, de fuerte sentido humanista y \u00e1spero realismo, lo consigui\u00f3 Ribera mediante una pincelada que deja surcos en la superficie, y as\u00ed muestra la devoci\u00f3n del ap\u00f3stol y enfrenta al espectador con una profunda experiencia religiosa.

Still, he had no qualms about providing his Catholic clients with pictures suiting their own faith, nor did he baulk at ribald subjects. Of course, we can if we wish interpret his piquant works as moral parables, which point out mans destiny if he surrenders to his lecherous desires. Indisputably, though, the host of Salomes, Judiths and other demonic women of fate that swarmed from Cranachs studio owed their popularity rather to their thrilling sensuality. They are icy, sadistic and triumphant, in the extreme attire of classy ladies of the time, and what is more they are endowed with the facial features of the illustrious beauties of the Wittenberg court. Salomes name is not mentioned in the Bible; her bizarre cult was born only in the sixteenth century, to be revived by the decadent aesthetics of the late nineteenth century. Strictly speaking she was little more than a tool for her mother Herodias to get revenge on Saint John the Baptist, who had spoken out against her sinful relationship with the king.

Oddly, the artist did not match the patterns of the sleeves, as would have been customary during this period.   In fact, the duchess never actually sat for this portrait, which may account for the misunderstood representation of her clothing. Scholars believe that the artist copied Isabellas likeness from a lost portrait by Rogier van der Weyden. The tender, slightly mocking expression on the duchesss face and the elongated fingers reflect van der Weydens concept of portraiture.   The prominent inscription in the upper left corner of the panel, PERSICA SIBYLLA IA, suggests that the portrait was part of a series depicting sibyls.

Leonardo was commissioned to decorate one of the two longer walls of the hall around the middle of 1503. His composition commemorated the decisive military victory in the history of the Florentine Republic, the triumph over the Milanese at Anghiari in 1440. Leonardo worked on the battle scene from October 1503 with interruptions until May 1506, when he returned to Milan, leaving the unfinished work behind once and for all. He devised an oil-based technique for the wall painting, which rapidly deteriorated, but his mural was nevertheless regarded as one of the principal sights of Florence; its last traces were obliterated by Giorgio Vasari during his renovation of the hall in 1563.Although neither the wall painting nor its cartoon (a full-scale drawing used directly for copying the composition onto the wall) have survived, with the help of contemporary accounts, copies and Leonardo\u2019s extant sketches, the destroyed work can be reconstructed. Out of the complete composition Leonardo only painted the crucial episode of the battle, when the young Florentine captain-general, Pier Giampaolo Orsini, is just about to wrench the standard from the hand of Niccolo Piccinino, the Milanese condottiere. Leonardo created the masterly red chalk drawing depicting Pier Giampaolo Orsini in profile as preliminary studies for the full-scale cartoon. The scene, in which, in the words of Vasari, \u2018rage, fury and revenge are perceived as much in the men as in the horses\u2019, offered a perfect opportunity for the representation of intense emotions and extreme states of mind reflected on the human face. The vitality of the Budapest study results from the use of live models. The dramatic force of expression faithfully recalls the shocking horror of the brutal fighting rage of the soldiers, rushing on each other with unrestrained ferocity in the heat of battle, which Leonardo termed pazzia bestialissima \u2013 most bestial madness"}, {"title": "The Four Horsemen", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-mlQfZOIfNsyUa4ZzqJQWvXdz0JmUE8wfj2rNYaoF5Ze6I9rEqpoV5LOtsNjbc7lbjQZf9wA", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Foundation of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rom", "artist": "Tommaso di Cristoforo Fini", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM89fOES2zM2l5A-hVBK3cPF0Hnt6gqVU6lcEMCndGQ84lUsna_6Jau5kGWgk93GaWJ3blR9BpWY", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Holy Family with a Shepherd", "artist": "Titian", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9ZU0C98Anc0HxckzyQLGV_oTndCDFH5-B4oeaqLXIP6yepQZH-FFU-FeYP5mhgRRLsyo0RTms", "desc": null}, {"title": "Madonna and Child with St. Peter Martyr", "artist": "Lorenzo Lotto", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9e1vmzXVSCiBOFCUAWKxUpqbPqrCn37AM1Qee6_MQI1hw8sxIdIyuhpzd7FDW0ZwCFNCFDxw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Mary with the Child", "artist": "Andrea del Verrocchio", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9pt6h4mD8gjvtqi9JWz9UEWNWHum_eqg5GFl-oGfZYq_fD9zKqkxs3OMyHYpJn64qs1mYE", "desc": "Only two paintings have been definitely attributed to Verrocchio.

The disguised god is intent upon Callistos seduction and will most likely succeed since she has failed to notice his accomplice, an eagle, lurking above the pink satin curtain"}, {"title": "The Fall of Man (Adam and Eve)", "artist": " http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-fall-of-man-adam-and-eve-246", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM93biVmmU-JQfFRKzFcdj8YwIMocWX1Lwhnee-iZNiHW3tVl6AA3bu3lv2keMitxSuwX2QNry4", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Angel with the Key to the Bottomless Pit , from The Apocalypse", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9DnnIRJFjdfMm5SANoNt9WgWtS56Sy7_JehVrPojoF46ci7ABq2cm44MAXoQFuEXRfJ9EM8jUo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Apparition of Jesus Child to St. Anthony of Padua (?)", "artist": "Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM85wxRHZZwAgOJwa3BtqnaFKzYLg9MP-qirFAYF45w0om1x1cw-vOb34k79WX0Yp6HzZYpLRw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Sebastian Bound to the Column", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM88GAT6_9B517BCSctDQ8R0t4tfenRVlJ4YDEe91sBNGrKQnzIt8cQCRIiLubWalMAns2fMvaI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of Alfonso V, King of Aragon (Retrato del Monarca Alfonso V, Rey de Arag\u00f3n)", "artist": "Juan de Juanes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Sh70ScViKIRLp7tqs7GBGvSJlTZ6l4rOdu6w3nq1RMJ7qT2QqQ0FIICEl7fGlIEGSaBsz", "desc": "Portrait commissioned by the Valencia jurats\u2014the citys supreme governing body\u2014and entrusted to Juan de Juanes.

This is a curious art, with a radically different approach to that of Italian contemporaries, who incidentally were enthusiastic admirers of Northern paintings; indeed, it was from these that they picked up the knack of painting with oils. But this technical innovation, which charmed onto the surface a vitreous shine like a transparent precious stone, is only one of countless means with which these pictures enchant the receptive viewer. The aesthetics of small is beautiful, the meticulous and affectionate execution of every minute detail of the depicted world, is what makes this refined style so vivid. The jewelbox-like town of Bruges, where David settled as a young man, looks as if it were the essence of this tradition. Here worked the most eminent painter of the time, Hans Memling, whose elegant, courtly style exercised a decisive influence on the youth. As the cityscape visible in the background is enlivened with all manner of small details, so the story is enriched with all kinds of episodes, in order to bring the miracle closer to the viewer, that it be more directly experienced. For instance, the candle in Josephs hand reminds us that actually it is night, though the light radiating from the newborn shines bright as day over the landscape.

As enticement, Juno offers Aeolus her most beautiful nymph, Deiopea, in marriage. She aims the torch directly at his heart as love-struck Aeolus releases the winds, while a cupid unsheathes an arrow to target the compliant nymph, her wrists bound with pearls.

The unusual combination of Venus and organ player, which exists in a few other variations, is an iconographic innovation by Titian. There are contradictory hypotheses about the origins and interpretation of the painting: some say that the picture follows neo-Platonic ideas by symbolically representing the senses of seeing and hearing as they recognise beauty.

A young satyr dances with a goat in the center and all are enclosed in Lorrains distinctively ebullient, pastoral nature. The right half of the picture plane is lost in the green shade of small hills, while the left part of the image stretches to the distant mountain range. The sky and clouds that spread above this open plane are filled with an Italianate clarity, providing an interesting contrast to the skies seen in the works of Lorrains contemporary, van Goyen (see cat. no. 35).\tLorrain collected a large number of sketches recording his own compositions in an album entitled Liber Veritatis (British Museum, London), and number 108 (1646-47) of these drawings repeats this same composition. From this evidence it has been concluded that this work was created under commission from the wealthy Lyonnaise merchant and humanist, Philippe Silvestre Dufourt. Lorrain rarely depicted this theme of satyrs and nymphs, indicating that Dufourt particularly requested this subject. Scholars have suggested that the work may have been commissioned upon the occasion of a wedding.

At the time Cranach painted this portrait of the heroine, he had been working as court painter to the elector of Saxony for almost twenty years. The tax records of the city of Wittenberg list him as its wealthiest citizen. All the known versions of the half-length portraits of Judith from Cranach\u2019s largeworkshop were painted around the year 1530. This striking concentration was apparently related to the founding of the Schmalkaldic League: Judith became a symbol of armed Protestant resistance to Charles V and his Catholic armies. Given this connection with contemporary history, Judith\u2019s character as a mankilling femme cruelle, emphasised in other paintings, becomes secondary. Nevertheless, Cranach\u2019s Judith also shows a trace of eroticism. Her long, flowinghair, costly and fashionable clothing, low d\u00e9collet\u00e9 with gold jewellery and the delicate gestures of her hands create tension with the openly displayed head of the enemy general and the erect sword she demonstratively holds in her right hand. But this is only one side of the story, because on the other hand Cranach\u2019s choice of colours results in a subtle unity: the deadly character of this Old Testament murder is depicted in a variety of carefully nuanced shades of red. The style of Cranach\u2019s Wittenberg paintings \u2013 regardless of the subject \u2013 is unmistakable: his compositions are always two-dimensional without reference to the surrounding space and usually also have a decorative effect."}, {"title": "Landscape with Merchants", "artist": "Claude Lorrain", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-pPHoSKNOSAtXKFyzhlfKzRiYAqJ_H1GEWRO1Pr8vVTJHgBDiLW2FADReC6932T5LqwmGDJA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae: Doric Entablature", "artist": "Agostino Veneziano", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-e1Yv0HQ13BZ3sqMoX-R_TCbMR39p7Ru1fa8XJUYjlXmAaoJZqX3lFt-lc9h6HfOsoVMBpSA", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Tribulations of Saint Anthony", "artist": "Martin Schongauer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9vY_4aK8tCPozE7MEu2xNWIuc73hDf3kOWpXAMs_U3TGSGl-KMNxX4xKy79JwNgmjrhc4Asw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Skelet van een rat", "artist": "Ligozzi, Jacopo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-AgnvgtY2_JPCAmJry4t-jI9Oct50HjHb0etmvP6uip7jdMw2A6e9xYU6UReUrW0lqnoRThA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christ as Saviour", "artist": "El Greco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-V--YnlnYQw6cHDocQW_cARCwCio6nPlhGjfEw9M2LFsVKOTBg-H6PQbMnboFpQbTNiXinUq4", "desc": null}, {"title": "Marie-Antoinette", "artist": "\u00c9lisabeth-Louise Vig\u00e9e Le Brun", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_ZPW8TneKBM5V8DNhHb_tzCfH2-ahvwITNrklNkhVpS_gFXQCC9J9CUYz56c7VX0DxwaDFPA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Virgin and Child with an Angel (Madonna del Latte)", "artist": "Correggio", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_EiJrgDvgL4FR1beXVdZa8JKruND4kIwAk-hXNR4EnvN4JL7Hw_XaqJWHsZ5d788txfCj_Zg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Cardinal Fernando Ni\u00f1o de Guevara (1541\u20131609)", "artist": "El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9lnJTKMdmVKY3o-MtHNRCxPkcUgvCKmv-Xj4CDlat8zSOe5dUxi5pAs5VVino-jDtKTXG2FGko", "desc": "This intense portrait depicts Fernando Ni\u00f1o de Guevara (1541\u20131609), who in 1596 was named cardinal and is dressed as such here.

En abril de 1469, con 16 a\u00f1os, contrajo matrimonio con Marco Vespucci. Aun casada, nobles y artistas se rindieron ante la bellezade la joven. El 28 de enero de 1475 en la plaza de la Santa Cruz, se llev\u00f3 a cabo una justa, La Giostra o Torneo di Giuliano que celebraba la alianza entre Mil\u00e1n, Venecia y Florencia y que coincid\u00eda con el cumplea\u00f1os de Simonetta.

Icarus, carried away with the fun of the flight, flew too close to the sun which melted his wings, leaving him to plummet to the ground. Pieter Bruegels fascination for ships and the maritime world may have been born from his hometown, Antwerp: one of the main commercial ports in Europe and home to some of the most prominent explorers and merchants.

During a peace congress that was seeking to bring an end to decades of enmity between France and Burgundy, van Eyck painted portraits of some of those in attendance, among them, most likely, Cardinal Niccol\u00f2 Albergati, who in his position as nuncio was one the most important participants in the negotiations. In Arras, van Eyck created a silverpoint drawing (Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kupferstichkabinett), which most probably depicts the cardinal. Here the Flemish painter not only captured the physiognomy of the aged cleric but in his notes also specified the coloration. The painting was conceived several years after the encounter in Arras. Some experts have expressed conflicting opinions regarding the identity of the subject. Beginning in the 7th century a specific hairstyle was obligatory for all Christian clergyman: the so-called tonsure, in which a small round area at the crown of the head was shaved or shorn. The subject of the portrait, however, does not have this feature. His attire is equally unusual: fur trim is not traditionally part of a cardinal\u2019s vestment. With consistent realism and accuracy down to the smallest detail, van Eyck depicts the distinctive and somewhat coarse features of the cleric. The monochrome, dark background focuses the viewer\u2019s concentration on the subject\u2019s face. Contrary to a myth in art history, van Eyck did not invent oil painting, i.e., the use of oil-soluble resins as binders. However, with the new technique he did introduce fine painting, which had already reached its full flowering in book illumination, to the larger format of the panel painting. The thinly varnished application of pigments created a previously unknown lustre and allowed van Eyck to achieve a high level of definition on extremely varied surfaces and to render exceptionally fine details."}, {"title": "Mary Magdalene", "artist": "Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8YunHrbqT0Sbynb5xCgz2ZeNZWlb0AYEjvKiZl-QqUlHawpULiT9rcXe0VDo-A8PnEZ1p02w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Head of Leda", "artist": "Leonardo da Vinci", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8TfBHoMCQTY8NRWN02ytBQxiIMIeAx3DJu5HSXaAVAJn6EOtA02BrVf33evgk22jvtxFdKLOk", "desc": "A drawing of the head of a woman turned three quarters to the left, looking down.

Square blocks of stone topple and fall from the sky. Above is a dark cloud from which jets of rain curl down. There are some notes written close to the upper edge. A cataclysmic storm was one of Leonardos favourite subjects during the last decade of his life, in both his drawings and his writings. These were in principle studies towards his never-completed Treatise on Painting, but the obsessiveness with which he approached the subject reveals a deep-seated fascination with destruction. There exist several long passages in which he describes with relish a huge storm overwhelming a landscape, and the futile struggles of man and animal against the forces of nature:Let there be represented the summit of a rugged mountain with valleys surrounding its base, and on its sides let the surface of the soil be seen to slide, together with the small roots of the bushes, denuding great portions of the surrounding rocks ... and let the mountains as they are laid bare reveal the deep fissures made in them by ancient earthquakes ... And into the depth of some valley may have fallen the fragments of a mountain, forming a shore to the swollen waters of its river, which, having already burst its banks, will rush on in monstrous waves; and the greatest will strike upon and destroy the walls of the cities and farmhouses in the valley. Trees and plants must be bent to the ground, almost as if they would follow the course of the gale, with their branches twisted out of their natural growth and their leaves tossed and turned about. Of the men who are there some must have fallen to the ground and be entangled in their garments, and hardly to be recognised for the dust, while those who remain standing may be behind some tree, with their arms around it that the wind may not tear them away; others with their hand over their eyes for the dust, bending to the ground with their clothes and hair streaming in the wind. Of Leonardos many drawings of deluges made at this time, ten are uniform in size and style, but not in technique - most are in black chalk only, though all are as meticulously worked up as the present sheet, which is finished with the pen to give a remarkably formal, measured quality to the destruction. Huge cubic blocks of a mountain arch over to crash down at the centre, sending curling waves of debris shooting out like shock-waves to blast the landscape along the lower edge of the sheet. Yet the dual nature of these drawings - both visionary and theoretical - is confirmed by the dispassionate inscription hidden among the clouds at the top, which reads: Of rain. You will show the degrees of falling rain at various distances and of varying degrees of obscurity, and let the darkest part be closest to the middle of its thickness.It is most probable that the deluge drawings were executed during the last couple of years of Leonardos life, when he was living in France at the court of Francis I (reg.1515-47). The verso of each is blank, and framing lines are still visible along some of the sheet edges, suggesting that they were intended as finished works of art. Many of Leonardos late drawings, such as his ideal heads have similarly high degrees of finish; it seems that they were produced purely for his own satisfaction and never left his studio"}, {"title": "Adam and Eve", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-36S5lTOivkXeQ1yLMnhjmlqrE7bxhzcMKkqqLEQveNawHAv_Sa2sWtftE_sr_-2PvGlKHB9k0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Tantalus", "artist": "Hendrick Goltzius", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8BsNSZKZq7iqOoME_0rapeMPLMDl9zOgqBLq155pmxNMQ_jW6c1RJPsXLFHMj8ZM21CflbNg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint George Killing the Dragon", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Fy9IL7c-1apjxwJ3qjn_LH3nBWT8oYK9pDQefFpRJNVKwEDV3AOzVY1BM2n9bpWbGNR-w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Philip", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8NaN3uNWLZc3R0RLKHlr7Sq_Q1BB7OXp6yUfNajFLhgiNG5ksWb3VG8Fmwy9765n42KYUsVoY", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Fall of Babylon", "artist": "Philips Galle", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_zeLG11UxTK6pC7QWbpXdLPKK-IRYxrprVcrQcOrGw2yCGaFcEG1P3t30MrEsPa03QE1EMOg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Big Fish Eat Little Fish", "artist": "Pieter van der Heyden", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-QeVfYctx_1XqdpaDe9avgQ11-VLUyORo9YtoreqAH2nhDDvPxy8A-VLwoXz1tWVxVIWQ2J1E", "desc": null}, {"title": "Diane the Huntress", "artist": "Cavalier d'Arpino", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8T9vp-iUQvYvU5qQiXFU4PitnTb9iLR7bhLItY9hf94cm4KlGcWwHG9PZdaUC2YvWeID04", "desc": null}, {"title": "Seated Young Male Nude and Two Arm Studies (recto), c. 1510-11", "artist": "Michelangelo Buonarroti", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-zJL1KyYOK-pEtoNkxOZvmv1aIaMHfugf921L67mrP2mOKXMuwehKLUEJO5zx_QKxGdqZT93A", "desc": null}, {"title": "Martin Luther", "artist": "Albrecht Altdorfer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9WJH1a6TZeADdLreNLmhAloNz_R2iXvnXbsAlHmcDkrBZiAH0Q_FdYWWWb9g02FvTlZRfQ7w", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Apocalyptic Woman, from The Apocalypse", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-cI1wWsrhwXv3xz7TNyuASIB4Bx-GFc3UmLuSQ2vdyCaYjafLFHBteGlvKJAkIRw8JRD3QBTU", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Flagellation of Saint Engracia", "artist": "Oil on panel", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-CfCYcBcGxJmnObPvf7cjMP3jGRqNoPr7Mnff9tJeHD0Ud2A2FtnHsIRlZ954SAje6w5PYLg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ornament with a Mask", "artist": "Sebald Beham", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_594GF5XXg4077NMtWe9LKVdosbO3bGWBLEK1g2Bh_8fvQmmv3K3Cp3lW7NtDxPKCRgSWd", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Apotheosis of Venice", "artist": "Paolo Caliari", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9kH_LiypJi1_GkKl8GIP7LO9-VVUkFKy92gwx3LMaOhhWqU5kmUp5iFjf5zNVb1s5DJZactjYh", "desc": null}, {"title": "Design for the Tomb of Pope Julius II della Rovere", "artist": "Michelangelo Buonarroti", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8HtlK6qxs3CZivhO9L77hBrX_k8URUKeO4-KerzTVsiACobUHpnj1KsXLXIUy6cQtYMibu7Zxh", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of a Man", "artist": "Hans Memling", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8P8zQCKkl7oZ6I8w4hhtMyU0Whe-RV6Aqz_NP0IWWwxHwnT8TkchfEVCmGRJUckNctFxqzGiM", "desc": "The thriving trade centers of the Netherlands provided an international market for talented artists such as Memling.

His work and life there are recorded in ten letters to his friend Willibald Pirckheimer. In 1506 the German merchants in Venice who belonged to the confraternity of the Rosary commissioned an altarpiece, The Feast of the Rose Garlands, for the German church of San Bartolommeo (now N\u00e1rodni Galerie, Prague). According to the inscription on the painting, D\u00fcrer completed the work in five months. In a letter to Willibald Pirckheimer dated 23 September 1506 D\u00fcrer wrote that he would leave Venice in a months time, but I must first take the portraits of some people I have promised. This painting is one of the portraits painted by the artist in Venice. The sitter appears as the fourth figure from the left in the The Feast of the Rose Garlands, where he wears identical clothes. He has been indentified as Burkhard of Speyer on the basis of his resemblance to a miniature portrait (Schlossmuseum, Weimar) with the inscription Burcardus de Burcardis Spirensis 1506. All three portraits record his distinctive nose, high cheekbones and small eyes in a three-quarter view, but the miniature is a half-length as opposed to just head and shoulders. In the altarpiece Burkhard is shown with ecclesiastical figures to the left of the Virgin. He may have been one of the German chaplains attached to San Bartolommeo. He may also have been related to Johannes Burkhard, from Alsace, Master of Ceremonies at the Vatican, and Bishop of Arte and Civita Castellana. Despite being placed with the ecclesiastics, however, Burkhard wears secular Venetian dress including the rounded Italian bonnet or beret and gown over a red under-jacket. D\u00fcrers work in Venice shows an interesting meeting of German and Venetian techniques. He would have been impressed by the rich and varied colours available in Venice and brilliantly exploited by Venetians such as the elderly Giovanni Bellini (c.1431/6-1516). Already painting with breadth and fluidity, he now combined vibrant colours in semi-transparent layers to sumptuous effect. His meticulous attention to detail prompted his friend Joachim Camerarius to write the legendary tale of how Bellini admired D\u00fcrers skill, particularly the delicacy with which he drew individual hairs. Asking D\u00fcrer for a special brush to paint several fine hairs with one stroke, he was shown an ordinary brush. For this portrait D\u00fcrer combined his exacting record of faces and mastery of line with Venetian colour. The head-and-shoulders format and sense of colour and light in this portrait were clearly influenced by Giovanni Bellinis late portrait style, for example Giovanni Bellini Portrait of a Young Man, possibly Pietro Bembo c.1505 (RCIN 405761) in the Royal Collection. It was thought the miniature was a copy of the painting, which therefore had been cut down. The vertical edges of the panel seem to have been tidied up, but there is no evidence that the painting has been cut, and the other portraits D\u00fcrer painted in Venice have the same close-up view of the sitter. The support of poplar or willow is Venetian, as is the gesso ground. This was modified by a translucent upper layer of a warm pinkish brown found on other German paintings of this period. The portraits tonality struck Abraham van der Doort, who recorded it in the seventeenth century as a red faced mans picture. The portrait is thinly painted so that the pink-brown ground can be seen in the shirt and in the modelling of the face, but the highlights are also warm in hue. Infrared reflectography and X-ray show that the edge of Burkhards hat was adjusted on his brow and both shoulders lowered. D\u00fcrer manipulated and softened the shadows in the nose and neck with his thumb or fingers. In the seventeenth century the painting was hung in the Chair Room at Whitehall, together with the kings most precious paintings, which included D\u00fcrers Self Portrait (Museo del Prado, Madrid) and the portrait of his father (National Gallery, London)"}, {"title": "Diogenes, seated before his barrel, reading from a book, a plucked hen standing behind him at right", "artist": " http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/354611", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8EzjX0IYrH_SsdL2TPocUfQCm3V4ZOz4QAyWI6IWTtT-wufyqyMfDDGRHsjZutRKYIIhz9wIQ8", "desc": null}, {"title": "Philosophy Presenting the Seven Liberal Arts to Boethius", "artist": "leaf", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Iv_KVCBTJgVqIgkZnvNMMU-vqsQSnNH2x62Pio8FiKCSg3z44au4OybD-AaNC-K9KyuLIc1WU", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Parable of the Fig Tree (Libra)", "artist": "Adriaen Collaert", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9xqMQbpNhmmUJCFWPD7HMLg22mbUkX7cqk87M2cwBRj8Nb4wNvAE2BWgEaj-kogDI38K-glQ5J", "desc": null}, {"title": "Adam and Eve", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM87T6bvyNbCpKrjFjtuiLD0x1H3tVKxnlkhoaKwwPJOSmL-S6WA3S0tG-hxLcDtIissCnSv2z4", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Satyr's Family", "artist": "Jean Honor\u00e9 Fragonard", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Ydu3Owx7SgvKGDqwD8tJfDZQoFiBe-zR7bi1W4sgzXw2195hQUIcdamAou5-Uvrug951Stg", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Middelburg Altar", "artist": "Rogier van der Weyden", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9fD-pDpqssTr-TeRIAToMHQ9TSKXOy4Jv1H_B4oecXF186p8Dq-KLgQC62WEnq6Tx0lCfs-xg", "desc": "The central panel shows the birth of Christ with the donor worshipping the child, who is lying on the floor of the stable, with a bright light around him.

Until the late 1530s his works are remarkable for their elegantsynthesis of various painting styles: he combines Giorgione\u2019s Venetian style of coloration and surface treatment with Lorenzo Lotto\u2019s sharp delineation of light and subjective approach. There is evidence of the veneration of St. Justina in Upper Italy as early as the 5th century; Benedictine monks later spread the cult of the patron saint of Padua across the whole of Europe. Beginning in the early 15th century, she is usually depicted as a young princess in a long dress and cloak, and carrying a palm branch. Moretto further emphasises her virginity with the presence of a unicorn. This painting, which in early inventories was attributed at various times to both Titian and Raphael, is considered a major work of the High Renaissance in Upper Italy. Statuesque in her tranquillity, the saint also reflects the work of Raphael and thus Roman art of the time. The connection between the saints, their attributes and the (unknown) donor appears to be quite close so that thisdevotional image also has somewhat the atmosphere of a love idyll. Takentogether, such details as the vertically falling ends of the scarf tied around herwaist, which gleam with a silvery light, the standing posture, which imitates the art of antiquity, Justina\u2019s palm branch and the animal\u2019s horn create a strong compositional structure that sets the saint off against the kneeling donor, despite the harmony of the composition"}, {"title": "St. Jerome penitent", "artist": "Girolamo Romani", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9IMA9q8wUsRtfPu931GbpseaIwyMFOTT8X_9dC3l0kcTbJEsCgdBAxCD7thl-2DTrHj5Ows1lY", "desc": null}, {"title": "Adam and Eve", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-cpLGoSzFLbBkj1Hu-X-CGXhgJvuJpVzGI4jSR_jFKNI-s6sVZPvI_CwiBNxrZt-r7p70XjFM", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Presentation of the Christ Child in the Temple", "artist": "Giotto", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8DzeAd37av6mQ7N7o7LB26wXoNOGGP-Js4qhz4E5b6uwRP0k7oXi170gxfe0FMUDBFQgop6qI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Laoco\u00f6n and his sons being attacked by serpents", "artist": "Marcantonio Raimondi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9LyjvtMfxMWDSbyAFys2ZBAfH345DIPEDCXKh8rAH2sNBrUNVC0_E3BosmLlDn7Euv39WK3w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Phaeton Asking for the Chariot", "artist": "Hendrick Goltzius", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9X5m3IIy8MfnHD1bJW2sw6srhcf9wWLmCehc2ugn2cE7Yw8mqYZHCKeCTBUAnh-aTdoT2kzSj3", "desc": null}, {"title": "Mrs. Ralph Izard (Alice De Lancey, 1746/47\u20131832)", "artist": "Thomas Gainsborough", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_DO13qdqzCcl9ITAj4IH5yFjAlVmEb2zeRwG2ZL2-A_sP8kPnepIvuTxiXB1Nxi-Q819OL2g", "desc": null}, {"title": "Samson Rending the Lion", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-iZTqxVp0yosWCYSWfeIewW8qu2unS-GQkWhVraUgMjbiCDz6sPpDk7lmJDqwZsAhfxjabPLDN", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Lady on Her Day Bed", "artist": "Fran\u00e7ois Boucher", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9tsfqgMiHAZRHvj6I_9kTw2jnwWIzBlCZEPXIEiby7HqAz5DNwF2H02INjLRiun7WHSlJpi8ZA", "desc": "When Marie-Jeanne Buzeau (1716\u2013after 1786) posed so pertly for this informal portrait ten years after her marriage to Boucher, she was twenty-seven and the mother of three children.

Executed in black chalk and touched up with white heightening and water-colour this extraordinary large drawing depicts two male nudes in exaggerated contrapposto poses each supporting a second figure on its shoulders. Maybe the nude studies are just two views of one figure, one view from the front and the other from the back, as a demonstration of the artist\u00b4s skill and ability to imagine the whole full round figure while drawing it. Remarkably highly finished, this drawing seems to have been intended as a semi-pictorial composition in contrast to the rapid improvised quality of more sketch-like drawn studies. The heroic male nude was the focus of much artistic interest in late fifteenth-century Florence and drawings like this permitted to Renaissance artists to study the proportions and movements of the human body, which led to a greater naturalism and fluency in their paintings.

When it came time for the daughter of the king to be sacrificed, St George rode out against the dragon and subdued it, allowing the princess to lead the creature captive into the city. While acknowledging this narrative, the Melbourne panel more closely follows the slightly later version of the story, told by Petrus de Natalibus in his Heiligenleben of c.1370, in which St George slays the dragon by beheading it with his sword. In the painting, the archetypal confrontation between good and evil is conveyed through the contrast presented by the spiky, bat-like black dragon and the saint with his sleekly rounded protective armour, and by the counterposing of the black monster and the saint\u2019s white horse.

He contrasted the elegant contours of her smooth, attenuated body and characteristically expressionless face with her intricately carved, classicizing coiffure, drapery, and armband. X-ray analysis has revealed a network of apparently interconnecting channels running from her raised left hand down to the base of the column upon which she sits, which suggests that the figure may once have served as a fountain. Marble works by Giambologna are very rare, but contemporary documents discuss a statue that scholars identify with this one.

His daughter Pero, however, who had just given birth to a child, gained entry to the prison and saved her elderly father by nursing him at her breast. This theme was especially popular in Baroque times because, on the one hand, it was an example of Christian charity (caritas christiana)\u2014next to faith and hope, one of the three Christian virtues. On the other hand, it presented an irresistible opportunity to depict an erotic image. Bellucci arranged his figures in the shape of a pyramid.

Here Gossaert makes a striking change to the iconography that was customary up to this time: while the painter is still shown during a realistic, domestic portrait sitting, Mary is depicted as Queen of Heaven accompanied by angels in a religious setting of architecture inspired by contemporary Italian models. An angel as a symbol of divine inspiration guides St. Luke\u2019s hand. Gossaert derived the name \u201cMabuse\u201d from his hometown of Maubeuge, a small French city, today on the Belgian border. In 1503 he was mentioned for the first time as a master in the Guild of St. Luke at Antwerp. Four years later he vanished for a time without a trace. On 14 January 1509, he arrived in Rome, accompanying a diplomatic delegation led by his employer, Philip of Burgundy (the admiral of Zeeland and the illegitimate son of Duke Philip the Good). He remained in the Eternal City for several months, a period that he took advantage of by eagerly studying the sculpture and architecture of classical antiquity, as evidenced by a drawing of the Colosseum (Berlin, Museum of Prints and Drawings), among others. Probably he had the privilege of viewing works that Michelangelo and Raphael had created for the Vatican.

In my view he is the only man who has penetrated the whole secret of nature,\" praised Delacroix his great predecessor. And indeed, in superior virtuosity, in graceful elegance perhaps only Tiepolo could compete with Veronese in the history of painting. He wallowed in formal tricks, yet remained classical in his spirit: his colours are pure as crystal, and create clear harmony; the locations are spacious and bathed in light; and underlying all the flamboyant cavalcade is a perfectly balanced geometric structure. And if others received more praise in the form of verse or statues, perhaps there was no painter whose direct influence was greater in the following centuries.

Vernacular Italian texts based on earlier Greek and Latin hagiographic sources popularized the lives of these cenobitic monks and recluses. This theme soon appeared in contemporary art too: in several Italian cities (Pisa, Siena, Florence) monumental frescos instructed the faithful on the exemplary life of the ascetic desert fathers. In fifteenth-century Florence versions painted on large wood panels were also made. Several of these, including the Budapest panel, survive in complete or fragmentary state.This picture shows various events from the everyday life of the hermits. Most of these cannot be traced to a precise written source and do not relate an actual story; they rather show the fathers typical activities, often emphasizing the harmonious and mutually supportive relationship between them. Several hermits are carried about in simple litters or pulled in hand-carts by their younger companions or, in one case, two lions. A holy man carried by four younger brothers in the upper left corner blesses a group of monks kneeling before him. Others go about their business alone: some ride deer and donkeys, some are depicted leaning on their walking sticks and crutches. Two anchorites have retreated into small hermits huts and are visited or fed by their disciples. Another two have retired from the world to inaccessible caves in the rocks and have their food lowered to them in baskets. Yet another recluse monk praying on a hilltop is fed by an angel. In the foreground the burial of the saint, perhaps the fourth-century hermit and church father Ephraim of Syria, can be seen. The saints body is laid in state on a bier covered with a red carpet and surrounded by monks who express their sorrow in various ways. To the right of this scene, two brothers tend to a vegetable garden separated by a fence from the house behind, in front of which two figures are engaged in conversation.The setting of these scenes is a fable-like, rocky wilderness scattered with trees, which must have best expressed for the late medieval Italian beholder the inhospitable environment described in the legends. As if to emphasize the latter, lions appear in several places: a lioness sees to her young at the entrance of a cave, a male lion rests in long grass in the shadow of a projecting cliff, and a third lion feeds on its captured prey on a hill. The rocky landscape also features several buildings, among them churches characterized by slender, Gothic proportions and accentuated by the bright light. In accordance with pictorial tradition rooted in fourteenth-century Italian painting, the buildings do not have realistic proportions and appear like maquettes when compared to the figures. In the foreground there is a stretch of water, perhaps referring to the Nile, over which anthropomorphic winds blow out the sails of fragile sailboats.The Budapest painting was once much larger: it in fact constitutes the left half of an originally c. 205 cm-wide panel, another fragment of which, corresponding approximately to the right quarter of the composition, was formerly in the Bartolini Salimbeni collection in Florence (c. 67 \u00d7 56 cm). The composition closely follows a monumental painting executed by Mariotto di Nardo around 1400, now likewise dismembered and divided between the Christian Museum in Esztergom and a British private collection. A third, intact composition that perfectly corresponds to the surviving sections of the Budapest-ex Bartolini Salimbeni panel, is in the Uffizi in Florence. Leading scholars have attributed both the Budapest-ex Bartolini Salimbeni and the Uffizi versions to the young Dominican friar known as Fra Angelico. At the same time, opinions on the Uffizi panel are not unanimous: it has been recently suggested that it is a later copy after the Budapest-ex Bartolini Salimbeni painting. The technical examination of both panels carried out at the Florentine conservation institute Opificio delle Pietre Dure in 2003 would seem to underpin the latter view.The original function of the Thebaid panels remains unclear. It is possible that they formed part of the furniture or wainscoting in a communal room (sacristy, chapter house) of a religious order that attached special importance to the values of eremitic life. Such orders included the Camaldolese and the Vallombrosians but recently it was also put forward that Mariotto di Nardos work was commissioned by the Dominicans at the friary of Santa Maria Novella in Florence. Alternatively, the panels could have been made for private devotion and placed on the wall of a family chapel. Indeed, such a panel, about 233 cm-wide and attributed to Fra Angelico, appears in the inventory of the Medici Palace drawn up after the death of Lorenzo the Magnificent in 1492. Another Thebaid, valued at less than a quarter of the previous panel and measuring about 78 \u00d7 226 cm, was at this time in the chapel of the Medici villa at Careggi. Regarding their provenance, the possibility also remains that the Medici acquired these panels from a monastic environment. Although the Budapest-ex Bartolini Salimbeni is somewhat smaller than these recorded pieces, if envisaged with a 10-15 cm-wide frame (whose former presence is attested along the edges of the Budapest fragment) it may be identical with either of them"}, {"title": "A Vase of Flowers", "artist": "Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8pPAyL-AcStJu_X1Azb_HrgxyZaWEmLauwAparxFp0ZGKLYFJDR-z5g0ZDCU8m5qbS5ebaAPI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Fonte Gaia", "artist": "Jacopo Della Quercia", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_zoNPXfnpS7V49THV4X1L-MWLdKmaj5fg0ULzOuZbZMdXuoQhn5nLo_HWDSpX7E3CJ-bEXIA", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Vendramin Family", "artist": "Titian", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-c8bCkZLfqCmsXhTY3SXs2fDvzx6XaZ1_-E0k-pLtzryJp443waMe_Q0aC6qhq-6OzlsAo", "desc": "The specific identity of the sitters in this, Titian\u2019s largest group portrait, is disputed, but the man in the centre is most likely Andrea Vendramin (1481\u20131547), while the one on his right is his brother Gabriel Vendramin (1484\u20131552), a significant collector of works of art. The boys are the former\u2019s seven sons. The reliquary of the True Cross on the altar still exists in the Scuola di S. Giovanni Evangelista in Venice.

Claude Lorrain\u2019s career is closely associated with Italy. He had learned perspective in Naples and figurative painting in Rome, where he also lived beginning in 1627, painting mainly for the local aristocracy. His pictures quickly earned renown throughout Europe, especially for his elevation of the sun as visible source of illumination to the status of principal subject in pictures flooded with warm light, and his free combination of coastal landscapes with Roman villas, ancient monuments, and mythological and pastoral scenes. The artist achieved this effect of diffuse light with a special technique: the exceptional nuance with which he graded his slowly drying oil paint created subtle, imperceptible transitions. He also applied the thinnest of glazes between the layers to produce his unmistakable glow. The Kunsthaus owns two works by Claude Lorrain; the Pastoral with the Arch of Constantine has an interesting provenance. It belonged originally to the English scholar and art collector Sir Horace Walpole, who showed it in the famed gallery in his country home of Houghton Hall in the first third of the 18th century. The picture was then forgotten, only to be discovered in 1989 during much-needed renovations in the attic. A double stroke of luck, since the sale of the painting allowed Houghton Hall to pay for a new roof, and provided the Kunsthaus with an outstanding piece of art history"}, {"title": "Virgin and Child Crowned by an Angel", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9EYGV35AaBvsK566C1gZpxzBzi5nkKrRzq0ytRV5FahsoNhXf_-y5UCEeP0h0pyhJCdc3TJ2s", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Rhinoceros", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_NLwk4bErocKaInr6PXdoUQuOz6ut6v9urQbrlLwwd1T6w_5cGbvNhipILxO0Q338bvfjNRQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Drunken Silenus", "artist": "Jusepe de Ribera", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-wc4tGoY21NfKPeHcxgPsgUxavQ0js238LZ5l3TpSKWiCsI8DeGznU30OHci7KRbeG0jnmbw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Melencolia I (copy in reverse)", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-46hcI1UcKp6RRCPBHLPk-R8TcGqP09vKLl1_JYDhduMi653WGhX1VL3c0GHZxfBv4ndkFQ35m", "desc": "The winged figure of a woman, dressed in a long robe, is seated at right; she rests her head on her left hand and holds a compass in her right.

Maria Salviati was the wife of famous military leader Giovanni delle Bande Nere de Medici (d. 1526) and the mother of Cosimo I (1519-1574), grand duke of Tuscany. The little girl holding her hand here is probably Giulia, a Medici relative who was left in Marias care after the murder of the childs father, Duke Alessandro de Medici (1511-1537). As Alessandro was born of a liaison between a Medici cardinal and a servant who, tradition has it, was African, this formal portrait may be the first of a girl of African ancestry in European art. The child was painted over sometime during the 19th century but was rediscovered during a 1937 cleaning of the work.    Although Maria still wears the clothing of mourning for her deceased husband, Pontormos elegant style conveys her aristocratic grace through her impossibly long fingers and her fashionably pale color (indicative of a life led out of the sun), which she shares with Giulia.

In 1536 he supplied Henry VIIIs armourer, Erasmus Kyrkener, with military equipment for the suppression of the Northern Rebellion. However, in 1541 he and his elder brother were expelled from the London Steelyard (the walled area where the Hanseatic merchants resided and did business) after a dispute with the Duke of Suffolk concerning payment for a consignment of lead. Born is documented in Antwerp in 1542 and 1543, and last recorded in 1549, when he submitted a formal complaint about his expulsion while in Cologne. This is one of a group of seven surviving portraits of German merchants by Holbein (1497/8-1543) all painted c.1532-3 and perhaps intended to be sent home to the sitters families. It has been suggested that the pose in Barthel Bruyns portrait of a member of the Born family (previously James A. Stillmann, New York) may have been copied from Holbeins painting and that therefore either Borns portrait, a copy of it or the preparatory drawing was originally sent back to Germany. The relationship is not that close and it is more likely that Holbeins portrait remained behind when Born left, since the portrait was in Charles Is collection in the seventeenth century. No preparatory drawings survive for the Steelyard group. These might have been sent back to the merchants home for their families or it may be that Holbein did not use preparatory drawings for these portraits. Derichs wealth is subtly displayed in the very expensive satin doublet and black fur-lined gown. This restrained elegance was the fashion in Cologne. His face is centrally placed and confronts the viewer; his elbow is precisely centrally below his face and his body is turned at a perfect angle. Infrared reflectography reveals slight but careful adjustments to the outlines of his shoulders, head and cap with freehand lines. The right-hand contour of the face was redrawn three times. Unlike the other Hanseatic portraits the inscription is on the stone ledge at the lower edge: DERICHVS SI VOCEM ADDAS IPSISSIMVS HIC SIT / HVNC DVBITES PICTOR FECERIT AN GENITOR / DER BORN ETATIS SV AE 23. ANNO 1533 . [If you added a voice, this would be Derich his very self. You would be in doubt whether the painter or his father made him. Der Born aged 23, the year 1533]. This suggests that the portrait appears to be so lifelike that you would doubt whether it is painted (by the artist) or is in fact the real living person (the child created by the father). Lack of voice is the final missing element, but no amount of artistic skill can supply this. The inscription suggesting that the portrait is alive because of the skill of the artist looks back at the classical tradition when Apelles could match nature with his art. The perfectly composed figure centrally placed above the inscription recalls the portrait bust of a memorial, yet the sitter is paradoxically alive, and his gaze challenges us. The idea that art could perfectly imitate nature, its permanence and the question of epigrams in stone lasting longer than paintings were much debated by contemporary humanists. Derich Born was Holbeins answer to Erasmuss eulogy of D\u00fcrer which described the artist as the new Apelles, and the sitters pose has been compared to that of D\u00fcrer in his famous Self-portrait of 1498 (Museo del Prado, Madrid). Many other sources, both Italian and northern, have been linked to the portrait. It does seem to be closely related to Titians Man with a Quilted Sleeve (National Gallery, London). Holbein made a second, small portrait of the sitter (paper on wood, Alte Pinakothek, Munich) at around the same date"}, {"title": "Christ rising from the Tomb", "artist": "Gaudenzio Ferrari", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Vw0SNmQfOIyLfnSpc4-LbdS2-auheDaSyoRLaiTLEDps9shXz03aIG4L6oBcDuMFGbP07OsI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Bildnis Martin Luthers / Bildnis Katharina Luthers", "artist": "Lucas Cranach", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_roxB9ahrmkOb9ALuWwyNwbw-Q7jT0w43n7A014fKfspC6paQ49iKBLPvrbJOkIfmTiRNeaMw", "desc": "Von dem Portr\u00e4tpaar, den sog.

Dabei hatte er sich an den Aufzeichnungen des r\u00f6mischen Redners und Philosophen Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 v. Chr.) orientiert. Dieser berichtet in seinen 45 v. Chr. verfassten \u201eGespr\u00e4chen in Tusculum\u201c, er habe das Grabmal als Quaestor in Syrakus 75 v. Chr. in einem Dornengestr\u00fcpp gefunden und freilegen lassen.

Plutarch hatte berichtet, Archimedes habe sich ein Grab mit der Darstellung von Kugel und Zylinder gew\u00fcnscht. Algarotti hatte Zuccarelli angehalten, die Szene m\u00f6glichst historisch korrekt darzustellen. 1748 erwarb Friedrich der Gro\u00dfe das Gem\u00e4lde und h\u00e4ngte es in eines seiner G\u00e4stezimmer in Sanssouci.

Although he never took in pupils, Caravaggio\u2019s enormous influence on other artists played a vital role in the development of the Italian Baroque. In this Saint John the Baptist, Caravaggio has traded idealism for what oftentimes became in his own time a controversial realism. He has literally stripped the Baptist of nearly all traditional attributes (halo, lamb and banderole inscribed Ecce Agnus Dei or Behold the Lamb of God), leaving the brooding intensity of his emotional state as the subject of the painting. Saint John\u2019s solemn pensiveness is reinforced by a Caravaggio trademark: the dramatic contrast of deep, opaque shadows, playing across the body and shrouding the sockets of the eyes, with a bright light that illuminates the Baptist from above and to his right. This stark contrast of light and darkness, the brilliant scarlet of the saint\u2019s cloak and Caravaggio\u2019s placement of him in the foreground close to our own space, all contribute to the dramatic impact of the painting. Evidence of Caravaggio\u2019s working method, in which he incised lines into the gesso ground to guide his hand while painting, can be easily seen along the sitter\u2019s left leg in the right corner. Caravaggio most likely borrowed the Baptist\u2019s pose from one of Michelangelo\u2019s seated prophets and sibyls on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, Rome"}, {"title": "The Witch", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8pLyOdVn4UCKYDH82hmAaBVJTCIMTBkq2FF_ryca2Ewj-GgpwXIl9LC1RDEv01pm5TX_gFUm0", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Drunken Silenus", "artist": "Jusepe de Ribera", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9YLJSRNXXhLevA87yTy1LwpgT5bRDc8yh722m1zQvLzvpSTffYgqUjwi0Ea_dFtiw--hRRgsQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Design Fragment for the Left Side of the 'Fonte Gaia' in Siena", "artist": "Jacopo della Quercia", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8xsNH7y62Gjq3vI_HDxiGnajQP7xvl_lYCm0ozllH1sz07pSSaBryt0F3JRYzQ5TLxGfO56w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Seated Man Reading", "artist": "Jean Honor\u00e9 Fragonard", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Jf-pry928R_A8z0KEj32f_er-26-RFLViIVs65qKBdI1kik6slxGj6LdNWaH3QL_R1lYZJQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Margherita Paleologo (1510-66)", "artist": "Giulio Romano", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_uqF1k8K3dGjghdmdgUzVpdINp4GNpaV6ZtxXIaun0zS-kQAjf12uypv4tZ0Pz9z-BIp7l", "desc": "This portrait by Giulio Romano depicts a fashionable noblewoman in a magnificent black dress. She is probably Isabella dEstes daughter-in-law, Margherita Paleologo (1510-66), at the time of her marriage to Federico Gonzaga, 1st Duke of Mantua. She wears a black overdress created from interlaced bands of black fabric edged with gold over a pale crimson undergown, and on her head an elaborate zazara (headdress). In the room behind her, a maidservant greets three visitors: two fashionable ladies and a nun. The painting was first recognised as the work of Giulio Romano in 1857-8, and the attribution has been generally accepted since then. A similar use of a mysteriously lit background space, in which the next episode in an ambiguous story is preparing to happen, can be seen in other works by the artist. Vasari complained that Giulio used black excessively, a pigment that can be detected in the background here. There is a Giulio study in pen and wash for the figure of the woman drawing back the curtain in the Louvre. It has been proposed that the sitter was Isabella dEste (1474 - 1539), daughter of Ercole dEste, Duke of Ferrara, who married Francesco Gonzaga, Marchese of Mantua, in 1490. If this is the case, Giulio Romano presumably painted the portrait after his arrival at Mantua in 1524 and before Isabellas departure for Rome in 1525. However, it has been suggested more recently that the portrait may depict Isabellas daughter-in-law, Margherita Paleologo (1510-66), at the time of her marriage to Federico Gonzaga, 1st Duke of Mantua, in 1531. There is evidence to connect the costume worn here with Isabella dEste or her circle, which would support either identification. The peculiar design of the dress has been linked to the knot-fantasies (fantasie dei vinci), the pattern invented by the humanist Niccol\u00f2 di Correggio in about 1493, probably specifically for Isabella and her sister Beatrice, wife of the Duke of Milan. From correspondence between the two sisters in 1493 we learn that Isabella had not yet adopted the fantasie dei vinci, but that Beatrice was planning a dress decorated with the device to wear to the Imperial wedding of her niece, Bianca Sforza, to Emperor Maximilian. By the date of this portrait this fashion had become more widespread in north Italian courts. The headdress (zazara) was also a fashion promoted by Isabella. The necklace resembles one in a Giulio Romano pen and ink drawing of c.1532-5 (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), made up of cut curving tubes and knotted looped cloths, though similar necklaces are worn in contemporary paintings by Bronzino and Titian. The sitter holds a rare and heavy lapis lazuli rosary with gold paternostri (the larger beads) and a devotional image (targa) partially visible at the lower edge of the painting. The Gonzagas passion for lapis was well known: several lapis rosaries are recorded in the 1540-42 inventory of Federico Gonzaga, and one appears in Titians portrait of him (Prado, Madrid). We know that Federico sent a corona di lapis to his young bride, Margherita Paleologo, who is described in a letter of 1531 wearing this and a zazara. In Margheritas inventory there appears a lapis rosary with 63 Ave Marie beads interspersed with nine gold paternostri beads, and a targa of St Catherine. Since the folds of the dress cover some of the stones it is impossible to establish that this is the rosary in the painting. Evidently the costume and accessories here could belong equally well to the Duke of Mantuas mother (Isabella dEste) in 1524 or to his wife (Margherita Paleologo) in 1531. The sitter here appears to be in her twenties and is certainly too young to be an accurate portrayal of Isabella in her fiftieth year (in 1524). By this time Isabella, who was particularly concerned with her image, refused to give sittings and required artists to base their likenesses of her on previous portraits. This portrait may have been attempting something similar. However, the features here are not close enough to images of Isabella at any age to make the identification more than a possibility. The other candidate, Margherita Paleologo, was twenty-one when she married Federico in 1531. She was described (in 1530) as having white skin, a long face and a nose like her fathers. The only reliable likeness of her is a medal by Pastorino Pastorini dated 1561 (British Museum), which shows a comparable shape of face, although a slightly different-shaped nose. The door frames in the background are very like those that still exist in the Camerini del Sole and delle Cappe, prepared for Margherita and Federico on their marriage, and are very different from those of Isabellas own rooms on the ground floor of the Castello. In 1530 Giulio and Isabella furnished the rooms and in the Camera delle Arme arranged portraits of Federico, leaving a space for the large painting that Messer Giulio is to make, which may have been this new portrait of the Duchess. The evidence is not conclusive, but taking into account the medal, the circumstances of the marriage of Margherita at the date of the portrait and the architectural features of the rooms prepared for her, it is Margherita who is most likely to be represented here"}, {"title": "Portrait of Marguerite of Navarre", "artist": "Jean Clouet", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9blnA6OlpdHA96dL523aGStDoUoNaYFZ2lKEHGD5JCJbbqcU244DMUf8L3ptZE4c7rYHvba80", "desc": "Marguerite (1492-1549) was the sister of King Francis I of France. The painting may be by his court artist Jean Clouet. The cupid brooch on her hat and ring suggest the portrait may celebrate her marriage to the King of Navarre in 1527. The meaning of the bird, a rose-ringed parakeet, is uncertain. It could symbolise marital chastity, eloquence or have a family significance: a similar bird is found in another portrait of her brother by Clouet. The golden knots on her headdress resemble daisies - marguerites in French.  In 1816 William Roscoe thought this painting was a portrait of a Florentine lady by Leonardo da Vinci. The enigmatic smile of Leonardo\u2019s Mona Lisa may have influenced the French court artist who painted this portrait. Both Leonardo and his famous painting were at the French court when Marguerite was there as a young woman.  The portrait was first identified as Marguerite by the German art historian, Passavant, who visited Roscoe in Lodge Lane, Liverpool, only days before he died in 1831.

Each image in the series is minutely worked to reveal the philosophy and character of its subject, an approach that would have appealed to the humanists of the day. However, Ribera distanced himself from the traditional iconographic framework for such images, and in spite of the fact that these works were meant to represent wise men, he painted from actual models and rejected all idealization as he created powerful depictions of their actual figures. If the inscription on the lower right of this painting is reliable, this canvas depicts the Theban philosopher Crates. This philospher, a Cynic active around 320 B. C., is known to have been the student of Diogenes and the teacher of Zeno, the founder of Stoicism. Crates abandoned his property to become a mendicant and the author of didactic parodies, tragedies and dramas. Crates is known to have been a kind, wise and fascinating character with an ugly face. However, the man shown here is not particularly ugly in Riberas philosopher series. This painting is known to have been in the collection of the Prince of Lichtenstein in the mid 18th century, and judging from historical documents, it is surmised to have been one of a series of six works painted for the Prince in 1636-37. Today this series is divided between museums in the west and the NMWA. All six works were gathered for display in 1992 when the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, held an exhibition on Ribera. That opportunity to view the six works together revealed that there are slight differences in the styles of the six works, and thus it is clear that some of the paintings involved work by Riberas studio. Of the six works, the NMWAs image of Crates was particularly noteworthy for its powerful, true touch.

He was just beginning The Last Supper mural for the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie. Inventor, artist, mathematician, naturalist, anatomist, engineer, and philosopher, Leonardo epitomized the quintessential Renaissance man. As a celebrated figure sought for important commissions, Leonardo worked for some of the most prominent families of Renaissance Europe, including the Medici of Italy and King Francis I of France.While he is now best known for works that celebrate notions of ideal human proportion and beauty, such as the Vitruvian Man and the Mona Lisa, his interest in physiognomy led him to seek out the full range of human expression and facial features. As the early artist-biographer Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574) recorded, Leonardo was \"so delighted when he saw curious heads, whether bearded or hairy, that he would follow anyone who had thus attracted his attention for a whole day, acquiring such a clear idea of him that when he went home he would draw the head as well as if the man had been present.\" This Caricature of a Man with Bushy Hair was one of numerous drawings of exaggerated facial form that da Vinci called visi monstruosi, \u201cmonstrous faces\u201d in English. They were eventually bequeathed to Leonardo\u2019s pupil, Francesco Melzi, who made them available for other artists to study and copy.At some point late in the sixteenth century, this small sketch was cut from a larger single sheet of paper on which Leonardo had made multiple studies of heads. What remains here, though, carries hallmarks of Leonardo\u2019s artistic technique. He used hatching\u2014closely set parallel lines\u2014to shade the figure. In this case, the strokes are drawn from the top left to lower right, a telltale sign of Leonardo\u2019s renowned left-handedness (right-handed artists typically hatch from upper right to lower left, since the elbow is used as a pivot). The figure\u2019s bushy hair reflects a technique that Leonardo pioneered and called sfumato, which relates to a softness of contour and blurring of boundaries, crucial to Leonardo\u2019s style across drawings and paintings. He remarked that light and shade should blend \u201cwithout lines or borders, in the manner of smoke."}, {"title": "Der Fl\u00fcgel einer Blauracke", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9rCroT3sgZO_JpM1xB2IL6Z8nZB254GZBcpUTAB2WTgKaWXQhpp_gfHiPMicLYQLC7E6A8eg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Issachar, from The Twelve Sons of Jacob", "artist": "Karel van Mander I", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9divhmRxZN3uwEVS8Ia6GvP0rzilC9w50qJSl9HSWCz0KyeLWKwu2F5oI7vvNXysJ22am1xfE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Coat of Arms with a Skull", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-yZZ2b_DFvxHON9swTfEib6EHzNvBRgQLR0hvmnB5CNa-wQOlhhwDjY9QSSwuuS4DzCg41gA", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Whore of Babylon, from The Apocalypse", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8czFISn3MXBOFG_T60YBtKo0Ibpx9LtsMp7dP9W8aDiA5CqmUXIRzIuPGzcyJPlJpKOfS7L7o", "desc": "By 1498, D\u00fcrer had published more than two dozen prints, which brought him to the attention of artists and connoisseurs not only in his native Nuremberg and other German-speaking areas but also across the Alps in Italy.

In a glazed case with plain gold mounts and hinged front. High-relief figure of St. George on horseback, facing right, slaying the dragon. He holds a sword with seed-pearl handle high over his head. Crimped gold ribbons and crescents form a pattern on his opaque blue-grey armour and on the translucent red enamel of the horses caparison. The dragon below is covered with opaque blue and white enamel and has yellow legs and claws. In the background to the left is a walled town in opaque white and blue. To the right is the Princess, kneeling in prayer and wearing an opaque grey dress. The scene is surrounded by a raised frame with scale-like ornament in black enamel and gold. The reverse has arabesque-style ornament of crimped gold ribbons inset with stylised gold rosettes on translucent green enamel. There are large areas of loss to the enamel on the surrounding frame; parts of the dragon have been restored with cold enamel. This jewel has long been identified as belonging to a homogeneous group of small gold reliefs (\u00e9mail en ronde bosse), distinguished by their style and enamelling technique. The workshop where the pieces were made can be dated c. 1500-20 and several hypotheses exist regarding location, ranging from Spain and southern Germany to the Danube region. More recent and convincing are arguments ascribing the group to the Southern Netherlands in the wake of the great Burgundian tradition of enamelling. The badge reveals an unusual iconography. St George is usually represented as a young beardless knight with helmet. Here he has a full beard and an abundance of richly curled hair. These features correspond almost exactly to those of Frederick Barbarossa (r. 1152-90), as shown in a print on the title page of his biography written by Johannes Adelphus and published by Johannes Grunung in Strasburg in 1520. In this book, which was reprinted eight times between 1520 and 1629, Barbarossa is depicted as the epitome of the virtuous knightly warrior-emperor. The book appeared at a moment of Humanist interest in the glories of the Staufer emperors and encouraged by Maximilian I of Habsburg, Holy Roman Emperor (r. 1493-1519), to enhance his own political status. After his marriage to Maria of Burgundy in 1477 Maximilian I became ruler of the Southern Netherlands. In the light of this 16th century revival, it may be that this representation of St George, with the features of the great emperor, was intentional. Moreover, Maximilian himself was referred to as der letzte Ritter (the last warrior) and was frequently commemorated in the guise of the gallant St George in armour. Maximilian died in 1519 and it is known that Charles V, his grandson and successor, was in Antwerp in 1520. It is just possible that this badge was executed on this occasion as a means of honouring the Habsburgs by alluding to the virtues of their Staufer predecessors and their imperial ideal. The link with Maximilian is strengthened by a curious tradition attached to this jewel: it was known as the Holbein George and was traditionally believed to have been worn by Henry VIII. There is no means of verifying the tradition that this was the riche brooch with ye image of sainet George worn by Henry VIII which may have been presented to him by Maximilian. There is, however, no evidence that any of Henry VIIIs jewellery has survived in the Royal Collection and the tradition may have become attached to the jewel while in private ownership. Whilst it is not known when the badge entered the Royal Collection, it is exactly the type of jewel George IV acquired from Rundell, Bridge & Rundell the Royal goldsmiths from 1797 to 1840. It was probably the curious ancient enamelled Badge of the Garter, in glass case listed in an inventory of jewels at Windsor Castle in 1830 and the ancient Badge Tudor recorded there in 1837"}, {"title": "The Babylonian Whore, from The Apocalypse", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_nugt7z56TahtDD6EoU0m8ZQRB97APPU1DfmZ3win48NVwzlGZqwNTgZDlIx9x7d44wNQNPvE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Jesus Among the Doctors", "artist": "Simon Bening", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-we7t4Pcy-O24lizVeWIIv3a7elwLiFKXPQudqedhPtj8btQWqJh8LK7cbFY9qdeOfGrbY", "desc": "The twelve-year-old Jesus sits on a chair in the center of an octagonal edifice set inside the enormous Temple, visible through the arches.

This small work is an oil sketch for one of these works, St. Justa and St. Rufina now in the Seville Museum. Except for several discrepancies in the pottery at the feet of the saints, this painting presents almost exactly the same composition as that of the completed work. The work depicts the two patron saints of Seville, holding the hemp leaves symbolic of their martyrdom in their hands, and supporting a miniature of the citys symbol, the Giralda Tower. The completed work is from the artists most accomplished period in the 1660s, showing his mature figural style amidst a light-filled sky. While this work is simply a study and hence we cannot expect to find Murillos typical elements here, instead it provides us with a direct reflection of the artists ideas and aesthetic sentiments. A sketch of almost exactly the same composition is now in the collection of the Bonnat Museum in Bayonne in southern France.\tSt. Justa and St. Rufina were sisters and Christians famous for their pottery who lived in Seville during the Roman Empire. When they refused the order for pagan ritual implements from a Roman priest, they were martyred in Seville sometime around the year 286. Pottery became the symbol for the two saints, and the Giralda Tower is frequently shown in works depicting the two sisters. This inclusion of the tower is based on the tradition that the sisters descended from heaven in 1504 and embraced the tower to protect it from a great earthquake.

These factors indicate that the painting was originally the right painting in a pair or diptych, and it can easily be surmised that the pendant work would have been an image of the Grieving Madonna inscribed with the first half of the text, \"is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by\" .Here Christ is shown wearing a long-sleeved scarlet robe, with hands clasped in front of his chest. This pose differs from that of the \"Ecce Homo\" image with his hands widespread, and also diverges from the \"Man of Sorrows\" image with its lack of his wounds. According to Panofsky, this new type of Christ iconography known as the \"Imago Salvatoris Coronati,\" combining the Salvator Mundi with Christ suffering the Passion, was created by Dirk Bouts. Members of Bouts studio made a number of copies of this image to be paired with images of the Grieving Madonna. According to Sch\u00f6ne, this painting is one of the best replicas of the original Bouts painting thought to have been created around 1450. The red-eyed figure of Christ, crying as he suffers, combined with the crying figure of the Madonna reflects the careful finishing of details and the sentimentalism-laden religious sensibility characteristic of Bouts and early Flemish painting.(Source: Masterpieces of the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, 2009, cat. no. 7"}, {"title": "Madonna and Child with Saints James Major and John the Evangelist, altarpiece", "artist": " http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/17741/Madonna_and_Child_with_Saints_James_Major_and_John_the_Evangelist_altarpiece", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-AFrNsn4clwNQQmoI3FZhfjxEvk1GmiBuhJYoD2TX-QeB7kX4lq0uETHfauCjeJu9TQdb4364", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Griffin", "artist": "Israhel van Meckenem", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8RtVQ1qaDkCn3ctoLor1T-bLhjHvfoPJ5Rlfvf-29EyWO_wytsZH6D-_RZnl9suNtrC7Xtpw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Virgin and Child in a Domestic Interior", "artist": "Petrus Christus", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9otJ3K-GHdvxe5KeutnMGwx83l2_XQ0N4hiGktPKuEE2sBTyPB9zBCXTbjazuqtTBO49GT", "desc": "This painting is one of the masterpieces of the Nelson-Atkins collection.

Leonardo was commissioned to decorate one of the two longer walls of the hall around the middle of 1503. His composition commemorated the decisive military victory in the history of the Florentine Republic, the triumph over the Milanese at Anghiari in 1440. Leonardo worked on the battle scene from October 1503 with interruptions until May 1506, when he returned to Milan, leaving the unfinished work behind once and for all. The last traces of the fresco were obliterated by Giorgio Vasari during his renovation of the hall in 1563.Although neither the wall painting nor its cartoon (a full-scale drawing used directly for copying the composition onto the wall) have survived, with the help of contemporary accounts, copies and Leonardo\u2019s extant sketches, the destroyed work can be reconstructed. Out of the complete composition Leonardo only painted the crucial episode of the battle, the Fight for the Standard, the moment when the young Florentine captain-general, Pier Giampaolo Orsini, is just about to wrench the standard from the hand of Niccolo Piccinino, the Milanese condottiere. Leonardo created the Budapest sheet as a preliminary study for the full-scale cartoon, and the head in half profile was executed for the Milanese condottiere. The vitality of the drawing results from the use of live models.

In 1521, Patinir met the illustrious German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer, who was visiting Antwerp at the time. The two men are said to have been on cordial terms and were evidently impressed by each other\u2019s work. D\u00fcrer was even invited to Patinir\u2019s wedding.

He took up his vocation as a painter in Crete but around 1568 was in Venice, where he evidently studied the works of Jacopo Bassano, Tintoretto, Titian, and Veronese. Arriving in Rome in 1570, he became part of a circle of learned churchmen and other notables who shared an interest in the classics, literature, and art. El Greco left for Spain in 1577, possibly in the hope of obtaining more commissions than he had received in Italy. He seems to have pinned his hopes on Phillip II, who was recruiting painters for the decoration of the Escorial palace near Madrid. Although rejected as a court artist, he secured commissions in Toledo, and took up permanent residence there, becoming a citizen in 1589. He developed a highly original style characterized by the elongation of the human figure and flickering brushwork, and he painted mostly for churches and religious orders in and around Toledo, notably the masterpiece, The Burial of the Count of Orgaz. Recalling the traditions of Byzantine icon painting, El Greco adopted a close-up view, thereby charging The Repentant Saint Peter with great feeling. Significantly, El Greco figured in Duncan Phillips\u2019s attempt to employ baroque as a critical rather than a chronological category: \u201cIt is possible to be classic or romantic, realist or abstractionist, impressionist or expressionist in a baroque way.\u201d While recognizing the importance of El Greco\u2019s stylistic innovations for modern artists, Phillips maintained that El Greco\u2019s plastic means were in the service of the artist\u2019s own inner life, invoking another twentieth-century notion as he claimed El Greco for expressionism. Phillips insisted that El Greco\u2019s emotional expression was ultimately submerged into a classical feeling for order: \u201cAs for El Greco, where in the history of art is there a better example of that search for unity and integration which the romantic artist requires to make his passionate utterance intelligible?"}, {"title": "Christ in the House of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus", "artist": "Jacopo Bassano", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM80wyEdAYAvr9_GKoB9QjUYhhJzBy7IYpItGgE-Rr_6cXfdvQaIjgeKBqwYtqLXoOoh1pJ4mA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Knight, Death and Devil", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-zFh91UtaiI5Pl2AJlAdn530I_aQAEk_qKhl-q6nhE19Pp8SSqikpWp7BPPjWgrTs1-O-Q0g", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Bishop", "artist": "Martin Schongauer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9g26QGbRZkrPmNdBgYGEtSj52OWi2hB0KY9M2mvNf58JPXeNfvwwUB-frqCyOiYgBZ0iGdnFLE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Joachim and the Angel, from The Life of the Virgin", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-NzfqjYnyfzUAZwXofwLZUeE-GYzi6_YW1wgAgSgX2SPBu7w9CrOzhCrD3FCkvyl2SbiZRFg", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Intoxication of Wine", "artist": "Clodion (Claude Michel", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9LUtaIskPFnT6QICGwb2MN-QkuZ0Q3IxkkqyyZHauhqmCg5mx2JzcJa6g5r9-tTXJ4lRHezQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Noblewoman, from The Dance of Death", "artist": "Hans Holbein the Younger", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_EHJJllzFpAWXbAF_PdYSKp7OD1qLUMh2AaZz2ONsHXG_YMtG5Ox7P0XbhZ1acluZydOGrvA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Madonna of the Magnificat", "artist": "Botticelli", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Fz7kriXbgSZitGG9MUfuabjzogKIep1NvtZ_uzpGar1rUEYBJ-A5dtVqaAfS-lUfolkmk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Wild Man Holding a Shield with a Greyhound", "artist": "Martin Schongauer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_5pddWxDxFrYPh6U5VNL1-mps1TpLNwGjPvc8AF9pZwDLUYhAMV6jKAcO8jkWwmCfrlGZCvew", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Paul", "artist": null, "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9n49jFUWnUxCIlOo9CKAXYR2GKStn5RJiQAp8QXx8-E2os2hMXVxiMdpvPpjYCJOQUSENq", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Eternal Father and the Virgin", "artist": "Raphael", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8p7AxFnFTBY6xW_-pWUYtVtXGgqJeVUmNTaKxZHgDWy2A0GKVR-LyWWLBaTxq4K9y_MzQBgdxx", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Blood of the Redeemer", "artist": "Giovanni Bellini", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8BKDtrDQia-ClyObBEY1aZ52Ke601zHbsAFQhWkmVAhccYRwDarwYAks4XUP7dtrHu-K24bYI", "desc": "In this early work by Bellini, Christ is shown as the Redeemer.

The meaning of this enigmatic work is elusive, but its title, given just a few years after the artists death. provides some clues. The highly finished drawing shows a winged spirit swooping down to trumpet a message to a muscular nude male youth, who leans on a globe. Both rest on a box containing a number of masks. In the background, groups of writhing bodies appear in a cloudy haze. The main figure has been interpreted as the human mind being awakened, as if from a dream, and summoned back to virtue from the vices. In fact, all of the seven cardinal vices - except for pride - are represented by the figures in the background; from left to right, they are gluttony, lust, greed, wrath, envy and sloth. The large moneybag hovering near the youths head symbolises greed. The masks in the box have long been interpreted as emblems of deceit and falsehood. This drawing demonstrates Michelangelos exceptional skills as a draughtsman and his ability to create powerful and complex compositions. The work exemplifies the artists distinctive method of modelling flesh with virtually invisible strokes, while firmly defining the contours of the figures. The almost waxy finish of the main figures evokes the surface of sculpted stone, and, by extension, Michelangelos extraordinary ability as a sculptor of the human form. The Dream has been associated with a group of so-called presentation drawings, highly refined compositions conceived as independent works and offered by Michelangelo to his closest friends, in particular a young Roman nobleman called Tommaso de Cavalieri. In his biography of Michelangelo (1568), the artist Giorgio Vasari praised these works as drawings the like of which have never been seen.

Both the bronzes subject--the Trojan War--and its small-scale format reveal the artists interest in classical culture. The handling of the figures, however, shows the influence of Italian Mannerist sculpture of the 1600s. The sculptor, Giovanni Francesco Susini, welded the three nude figures together in an intensely dramatic composition. While Paris attempts to carry Helen off, she valiantly struggles against him. Below them a female servant protests. The women twist around the central spiral of Pariss lithe body. Susini arranges the figures as if on a stage; both Paris and Helen turn their faces toward the front. Yet, the spiral composition also encourages the viewer to walk around the piece, offering interesting alternate perspectives.

However, the nearest village in Brabant by the name of Bruegel is about sixty kilometres from Breda. Van Mander also tells us that Bruegel received his training in Antwerp and registered as a master in the painters\u2019 guild in 1551. A year later, he went to Italy and spent some time in Rome. From a sketched view of Reggio Calabria in the museum\u2019s collection, we can deduce that Bruegel travelled to the far south of the country. His journey across the Alps seems to have made a particularly strong impression on him. In any event, he often depicted mountains in his paintings and drawings.

Made as gifts for his closest friends, they were painstakingly worked and often imbued with personal meaning, the nature and full extent of which are not always clear to us. Despite their intimate nature, most were soon famous through reproduction in engravings, copy drawings, paintings, relief sculpture and carved crystals. The Royal Collection holds five of these magnificent sheets: Tityus, the Fall of Phaeton, the Bacchanal of Children, Three Labours of Hercules and the present drawing. All may have passed through the Farnese collection in Rome, but the circumstances of their acquisition, probably for George III, are not known. No literary source has been identified for the subject of the Archers, but its neoplatonic meaning is so clear that it has no need of a specific source. A group of nude youths, both male and female, some hovering in the air, fire arrows (from non-existent bows) towards a target fixed to a herm. These arrows strike the herm and its base, and the edges of the target, but not its centre. Below, a winged cupid sleeps, his bow resting in his lap; to the left two putti kindle a fire. Thus mere striving - the frenetic actions of the archers, impelled by the burning flames of passion below - cannot achieve its aim. Only that which is guided by love will succeed; the winged cupid sleeps, and so the arrows miss their mark. The most curious element of the composition, the omission of most of the bows, may simply have been intended to simplify the composition and maintain the horizontal surge of the figures"}, {"title": "Portrait of a Young Man (The Broccardo Portrait)", "artist": "Giorgione", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9nyod22F5FGXw_95bqpzodOXUcdiqhU0Tch8osuSdMO60o_rLhG9AopAtTVwSQEB1W7Bm_9VE", "desc": "Even today it is difficult to define what the advent of Giorgione means for the history of taste. Like Proust, he taught that the world could be looked at in a more pleasurable, more subjective way. His recipe for doing so was to infuse painting with the lyricism and romance that were already current in the prose and poetry of his time. It would be hard to find a better summary of Giorgiones significance than the words of the great art historian John Pope-Hennessy. Though he died young, Giorgione utterly overturned the world of Venetian painting, and enshrouded not only narrative scenes in a magical, poetical atmosphere, but also transferred this approach to portraiture. So was born the introspective, emotive type of male portrait, of which the most inspired example is the Budapest Youth. Yet the image is also the most perplexing image in our collections. Its author and sitter are the subject of endless dispute, as are the meaning of the hieroglyphic emblems on the parapet, and even the very nature of the emotion which infuses the picture. Is the sitter in a reverie, tormented by the bittersweet pain of love, or does he exude some quiet melancholy from the depths - perhaps grief?

The hands of the artists are holding a plan for a building, they stand out against a black cloak, which in turn seems to emerge from a background similar in tone. Many hypothesis have been offered concerning the plan the architect is holding, indeed this project was probably never carried out. The round plan brings to mind many places in Mantua and elsewhere.

Like his rival, Aachen had spent a long time in Italy (Venice, Rome and Florence, ca. 1574 \u2013 1587/88). Characteristic of both are the combination of Netherlandish surface treatment and the Mannerist proportions and postures of the figures, which date back to Parmigianino. Thus both artists are regarded as exponentsof one of the last manifestations of European Mannerism. It finds its expression here in explicitly courtly features, which were personally advocated by Emperor Rudolph II. The clear preference for erotic subjects is also a distinctive feature of Rudolphine court art. Ceres, the Roman goddess of fertility, dominates the foreground of the painting in a striking rear view. Her elongated limbs and the opposing movements of her torso and head are characteristic features of Mannerism. Bacchus, the god of wine, has approached Ceres from behind. He tenderly touches her, looking ather in joyful anticipation, while she fixes her gaze on the viewer. The boy at the bottom left presents them with a basket of fruit and vegetables. Although the figure of the child has not been clearly identified as Amor, this interpretation would make sense: \u201cSine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus\u201d \u2013 \u201cWithout Ceres and Bacchus, Venus is cold\u201d (or figuratively: \u201cWithout food and drink, love cools\u201d). This quotation from the Roman dramatist Terence (ca. 190 \u2013 159 BC) has become a proverbial phrase and is probably the key to understanding this emblematic picture. The \u201cfreezing\u201d Venus, traditionally warming her hands by a fire, is missing.

Sculptor Claude Michel, called Clodion, frequently drew from ancient mythology for his terracottas, but his borrowings rarely focused on grand events. For Clodion, ancient culture provided a classical figure style, a repertory of characters and settings, and perhaps most importantly, a nostalgic mood. As was typical of the Rococo style, his works tended to be playful and erotic. Although Clodion finished the piece in the round, he designed it to be seen from the front, placed on a piece of furniture or on a mantelpiece.

In addition, his carefully executed cabinet pictures were highly prized by art-collecting prelates and aristocrats, and his mythological compositions of refined erotic content were always sure to find satisfied patrons. In Diana and Actaeon painted on copper about 1603-1606, he has visually translated Ovids playfulness and piquant wit with great skill and empathy. The subject is based on the Metamorphoses (III: 138-253), a literary source most often used by Mannerist artists. The unexpected appearance of the hunter lost in the woods raises feigned, not real, alarm among the goddess and her companions. They act out the role of the surprised bathing with charming affectation in five different ways, at the same time demonstrating the masters expertise in painting nudes in all sorts of poses and from all viewpoints. The second nymph from the left, her hair lifted by her sudden move away from Actaeon, grabs her companion but turns with flirting curiosity to eye the intruder. The hunter looks back at her, his pose mirroring hers, as if in the last moment before his transformation they were experiencing mutual love at first sight. Diana looks up at the valiant hunter not with the relentless hatred described in the myth, but with childish wonderment that leaves her agape. The way she splashes him with the deadly water could just as well be a timid gesture of invitation to lovemaking. The innocent, girlish faces are artfully contrasted with the round forms of mature female bodies. The vicious dogs attacking Actaeon, the waterplants in the foreground, the misty cave with roots growing from the cracks, the sun-drenched trees with their voluminous foliage and the smooth water surface are all superbly painted details"}, {"title": "7F Studies for the head of Leda", "artist": "Michelangelo Buonarroti", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM880t7smEW4pYCNsfKIDRytNCl7_MN-jB4Nhz1V0Qk0f_J1b127NA-p7h_cdQ4Z_aeiqTWyuQ", "desc": "The drawing is unanimously recognized as one of the finest and most important of Michelangelo\u2019s entire graphic production.

The snake has a womans face that resembles Eves. In the Middle Ages Church scholars suggested that the devil may have induced Eve to listen to him because he took on the appearance of a young woman so that would be comfortable having a chat. During this period, women were often described as ignorant and untrustworthy, features which this story reflects. The primary visual source for the compostion is an engraving representing Adam and Eve by the German master Albrecht D\u00fcrer and dated 1504. Besides the figures, the engraving features a dense wall of forest foliage that has been taken over by the sculptor to create a rich backdrop in relief for his figures. The German master populated the underbrush with a variety of animals, which in the sculture have been greatly reduced in number. Nevertheless, there is one detail that has tantalized scholars. The tall plants with yellow heads of grain have been interpretated by some as corn or maize from the Americas. This would indeed be remarkably early for their inclusion in European imagery; nevertheless, recent techncal examinations have concluded that the passages where this appears to be the clearest is in fact a replacement from the 1800s. The incomplete inscription on the basesuggests that this is one of the many works of art made in Florence to celebrate the triumphal entrance of Pope Leo X, a member of Florences Medici family, into the city on November 30, 1515. However this cannot be substantiated. The central coat of arms is the popes. To the right is that of the Salviati family, and to the left is that of the Buondelmonti family, demonstrating their support of the pope.

This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.  The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.

Before long she inflamed the secret lust of two of her husband\u2019s guests: \u201c[\u2026] they perverted their own mind and turned away their eyes that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments.\u201d (Sus. 1:9.) One day the two judges were lying in wait for her, but Susanna rejected their wish to lie with her. Driven by their desire for revenge, they accused Susanna of adultery. She had already been condemned to death when the young Daniel questioned the accusers separately about the particular circumstances of the actand thus exposed them as liars. Susanna was rehabilitated while the two old men were sentenced to death. Subtly lit and in a setting of richly varied chiaroscuro, Susanna\u2019s beauty occupies the foreground of the painting. Absorbed in her mirror image, she is yet unaware of the two intruders \u2013 unlike the viewer, who is thus forced into the position of a voyeur. Distorted perspectives, strong light contrasts and the dynamic retreat into the depths of the vast orchard are characteristics of Mannerism, and Tintoretto became its most prominent Venetian exponent. In an impressive manner, the Italian painter relegates the educational potential of the tale to the background, although from the viewpoint of the Catholic Church it would have been of compelling necessity to emphasise it.

He has literally stripped the Baptist of nearly all traditional attributes (halo, lamb and banderole inscribed Ecce Agnus Dei or Behold the Lamb of God) leaving the brooding intensity of the saints emotional state as the subject of the painting. Saint Johns solemn pensiveness is reinforced by a Caravaggio trademark: the dramatic contrast of deep, opaque shadows, playing across his body and shrouding the sockets of his eyes, with a bright light that illuminates the Baptist from above and to his right. This stark contrast of light and darkness, the brilliant scarlet of the saints cloak and Caravaggios placement of him in the foreground, close to our own space, all contribute to the dramatic impact of the painting. Evidence of Caravaggios working method, in which he incised lines into the gesso ground to guide his hand while painting, can be easily seen along the sitters left leg in the right corner.

Court painter to Duke Cosimo de Medici (1519 \u2013 1574) in Florence, Pontormo pioneered a new, sophisticated type of portraiture which championed elegance and aristocratic reserve.The sitters identity has been much discussed.

This young man would have been around fourteen or fifteen years old at the time of the siege, about the age of Pontormos teenage sitter.

In addition to hundreds of works of ancient sculpture, the collection included fifteen pictures by Caravaggio alone, among them The Crowning with Thorns. It is mentioned in the collection inventory as a supraporte, a painting destined to be hung over a doorway, and indeed the half-length composition is painted with slight fore shortening. Caravaggio\u2019s interest in the sculpture of antiquity, which he developed particularly during his stay in Rome in the period before 1606, is evident in the bent posture of Christ. There is a relationship with a particular model: the Belvedere Torso, which was mentioned for the first time in the 15th century and went on display at the Vatican sometime around 1530. With a complete command of anatomy, Caravaggio characterises the varied physical appearance of the protagonists. Christ\u2019s delicate skin is in obvious contrast to the bronzed appearance of his tormentors. His exposed, outstretched neck, which has been forced into a horizontal position, is a clear indication of the brutality of the action. Caravaggio uses decisive contrasts of light and dark to create a strong physical presence. Remarkable is his use of so-called incision, in which he used a sharp instrument to outline the principal contours of his composition on the surface before he began painting.

Using a narrow upright format, Correggio focuses the passionate encounter on the view of the delicate nude back, placing it in a setting that is warm and humid. With great elegance he depicts the erotic union of the god with Io, the mortal daughter of the river god Inachus: Jupiter\u2019s face shimmers softly through the grey fog as he kisses Io, while his hand gently grasps her waist; the supposed victim seems to have abandoned any thought of escape. The deer drinking in the bottom right corner gives the erotic motif a trace of Christian decorum: \u201cAs the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.\u201d (Ps. 42:1.)Correggio\u2019s ability to combine a mystical depiction of nature with the classical figural ideal and the expression of sublime emotion made especially his later works important forerunners of Baroque artistic principles. The present painting was created along with The Abduction of Ganymede (GG 276), Leda and the Swan (Berlin, Picture Gallery) and Danae (Rome, Galleria Borghese) on a commission from Duke Federico Gonzaga of Mantua, who most likely gave the two paintings that are now in Vienna to Emperor Charles V as a gift.

In 1535, when Heemskerck painted this panorama to complement Cardinal Ridolfo Pios famous collection of antiquities, scholars were still disputing which of these monuments were the most marvelous. Heemskercks interpretation of the narrative, the abduction of Helen, queen of the Greek city-state Sparta, by Paris, a prince of Troy in Asian Minor, an epic that stretches across the ancient world to Rome itself, was influenced by versions of the story that set events among the marvels of heroic achievements of the ancient world.

In spite of being a reserved dreamer he attained unparalleled success in the capital of intrigue and envy. He tamed even the archfoe of glory, time: the greatest landscapists of the nineteenth century - the British Turner, or the Hungarian Mark\u00f3, still chased Claudes mellow sunlight. For this is the secret of Claudes art: sunlight which permeates all and gives life. Whether he paints imaginary antique harbours, or the Campagna, the plains surrounding Rome, it is the light which clothes the view in the radiance of the Golden Age, and lends a cosmic dimension to modest settings. It seems as though Virgils ancient idylls have come to life, though the Renaissance castles dominating the area are much more recent. The castle in this drawing is the famous La Crescenza, which often features in Claudes pictures, and following his example later artists (such as Corot) were also fond of painting it.

A successful businessman with excellent connections to the French court, he had been living abroad since 1521, first in Bern and soon afterwards in Lyon, and had become one of the most important financiers of King Francis I. There is perhaps a relationship between D\u00fcrer\u2019s commission for this painting and the marriage of Kleberger to Felizitas Imhoff in 1528: Felizitas, the daughter of the well-known Humanist and friend of D\u00fcrer, Willibald Pirckheimer, had been widowed in 1526. Pirckheimer had initially sought to prevent the remarriage of his daughter. Kleberger, who was repeatedly described as a brilliant opportunist, may have used this valuable artwork, which in its conception would have suited the Humanist, as a tool in his courtship. To Pirckheimer\u2019s dismay, the bridegroom was to leave his new wife a year later. Kleberger is looking to his right in a decisive and concentrated manner. The almost unpleasantly moving paradox of the composition quickly becomes apparent: the bust, which appears to be pulsing with life, is cut off sharply at the bottom and is balanced in the circular opening of a wall. Only the dark background lessens the impression of instability. The Latin inscription is similar to that on classical portrait medallions, giving the name, origin and age of the subject as well as the cabbalistic sign of the sol in corde leonis, an expression of his astrological constellation at birth, which promised unusual power and strength. In consultation with Kleberger, D\u00fcrer used the four spandrel areas for other references to the character and position of his patron. At the left above,the astrological sign for Leo surrounded by six stars; to its right is the artist\u2019s signature. At the left below a figurative coat of arms: three green clover-leaves above a yellow triple hill; to its right the clover-leaves are repeated, but with the addition of a helmet to \u201cennoble\u201d them."}, {"title": "Saint Anthony Abbot Shunning the Mass of Gold", "artist": "Fra Angelico", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-nhpZQrhPYRnZRY7TOVw_ms2XO4zZG4cX1_pNL52jzJdv1hRgA7FJHJPhwrebBQczZ-mFP1w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of Mrs Lowndes-Stone", "artist": "Thomas Gainsborough", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-QudnCHKpqFif3DDuXh6SyPg_Hp48L00NfOTDXCdlIbzgulroC302hSk7hGg1gRcxWAikT", "desc": "This painting was almost certainly created to mark the marriage of Elisabeth Garth to her cousin, William Lowndes-Stone, on 15 July 1775. The composition broadly follows the conventions of the sophisticated type of full-body portrait introduced to England by Van Dyck in the 1630s, when the master was the official painter to the court of Charles I.The elongated figure wears a salmon-coloured silk dress and a transparent gauze shawl finished off by gold trimming. She is shown au naturel, on foot and framed by the landscape, in a manner that greatly appealed to local tastes. There is no opposition between the sophisticated style of the portrait and the model\u2019s informal pose and captivating sense of freshness. On the contrary, the piece retains the spontaneity that characterises the painter\u2019s best work in the genre.Although the painting bears some similarities to other representations of women made by the artist in the same period, it stands out for its unrivalled refinement.

A contemporary report suggests that Hastings commissioned this portrait as a gift for the Duke of York, who gave Hastings his portrait in return. George IV, who had already exchanged portraits with Hastings as a mark of friendship, purchased this painting at the posthumous sale of the Duke of Yorks collection in 1827. Hastingss appointments as Governor-General of Bengal in 1813 and Governor of Malta in 1824 were the culmination of a successful military career. He is depicted wearing the undress uniform of a colonel while ADC to George III, an appointment he held from 1782 until 1793. This is one of the last portraits that Reynolds painted with a sitter posed in front of him. Six sittings are recorded in the artists sitter-book in June and July 1789. On 13 July, the day after the last sitting, Reynolds recorded that his eye began to be obscured. However, a newspaper critic wrote on 28 September that the portrait would be safely as well as easily finished. Reynoldss difficulties in seeing are not apparent in this heroic image in which the sitters pose and stance suggest intelligence and confidence in the face of danger. The portrait is one of Reynoldss most impressive achievements in a career which saw him appointed the first President of the Royal Academy in 1768 and during which he painted many portraits of the leading figures of British society. His keen intellect is reflected in the Discourses on Art addressed to the students of the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1790.

The Venetian patrician girl was swept to the throne of Cyprus by her legendary young beauty and the caprices of politics. Rather than ruling, her role was to become a moral example - so decided Venice, which wanted the important trading post for itself. Thus she abdicated from the throne, but in exchange became the most feted celebrity in the city, a strange and exciting curiosity: a queen in the republic. When the leading Venetian master of the time, Gentile Bellini created this celebrated portrait, the bloom of her youthful beauty had waned. The painter makes no bones about this, and approaches his model with cartographical objectivity. The sumptuous gala dress is given as much attention as the face. The intricate rhythms of necklaces, veils, fabrics and jewels seem to combine to form a kind of eastern ornamental pattern: like those that Bellini studied so enthusiastically during his years at the Istanbul court. The braiding seems to symbolize the restraint of duty: it seems to fetter the woman, biting into her flaccid flesh, while she stands firm, without so much as a tremor. This makes the image an epitome of the rulers virtues: the dual triumph over external challenges and selfish inner desires. And this makes it the very masterpiece claimed by the confident words put into the mouth of the queen in the inscription: You see how great I am; but even greater is the hand of Gentile Bellini which portrays me on such a small panel"}, {"title": "Erasmus of Rotterdam", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9gVT_duU_BYyzIQaGxV3mT-lDrCiFibnAHQGw7_hRafWP1vvDLWoB4PBMl-h0gTDgKPQh4KiXI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Crucifixion", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-5zpzlgBuw8xtLIAmyS1Nj4MKBVhNGbNF9u9HYejKMpm49JyVen1YuBOhEPcjC6RX4WiiXFZg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of a Young Lady", "artist": "Federico Barocci", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8sPkeO0DGtHe2RKsiC2MCwt18xuBXjB5Ku3QcvAanMbW0HRX8b3JW0nHYrBSFNgmnnflHs4UM", "desc": "The aristocratic female figure stands luminous and cool against a dark background, turning her head towards us, looking down at the spectators whose gazes begin at the elegantly interlaced hands and are led upwards along the arms to the expressive eyes"}, {"title": "Sudarium Held by One Angel", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_t03ywI1FK4yV2fJ_MlS7FCkfggUrwtiNOJ-56uOXNvYmKBAWpXFoaNOOZ5qoC7zzkeO53CQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Monstrous Pig of Landser", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_liDpeC6M9T0GeAbgoM_10SuWXhqAfB7ucCnKamTReRsfaFgIYQuKa2ftoKg6WXQTfzPzMgw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Ascension, from The Small Passion", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_LUBxjOgt1bFes1YVHbeoHJOINv__qaeDrAUPoGCxf840SONjcHZTNpY0J3eXaGp4POtUkzJg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landscape with the Nymph Egeria", "artist": "Claude Lorrain", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-mxX0c5F7D0u4aoacnhB2rcKSL1gPElaZmeNS9e2vsHB_YtkBBFI6z82CzdbqF6GRJO55tBek", "desc": null}, {"title": "Madonna and Child", "artist": "Giovanni Bellini", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Vw-YUpiJ_9zHlNmZYMOFJ-ZkTEb-k4h_8jbhDXTmDrO_cpnnkPQsvqjXXoLP39cBJHm4IVRA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Paul", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8WSPH4mz8ZD_-qjNSewb3bZvAojlI58SoEeFUHN8KkQ2VlyvSdT4W3su0sE2zQz0kvrmdGqvQ6", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Man of Sorrows Mocked by a Soldier", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Q_GyohlhDHvSwsZrqnRsOE-HQZzr4AiCUZh-ROquAsXQzR1bbb0na9zXO9fCykDd2GmZRnYo", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Sudarium Held by One Angel", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-7MTl5nE4j0UWiO2_8LTgs6474w7IdTcduhOt1l-POL8bb-2eyqVwrpF3wOtq4dkE8D1X-5w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of a Woman, Possibly Madame Claude Lambert de Thorigny (Marie Marguerite Bontemps, 1668\u20131701), and an Enslaved Servant", "artist": "Nicolas de Largillierre", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-7GLZXaMuMaLndKO8_oWLq_A9uvNv7HyVh8kK5pi70uQ81pTsa7xTvdz3-db5aDKDaLXCN3xo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of Girolamo Mercuriale", "artist": "Lavinia Fontana", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-92gAPhUaVhYfZ0dl_X6ukg_NlyJsrOYMwLsfYUVsR4oVjDT4upED3d4MVtA6Mt3EgLfPNkCA", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Shipwreck", "artist": "Claude Lorrain", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-Hib8pRaSfiOWjVH_yqk9IzkTaGZhw7BXofw6PBo8QF0QYApIJd6pnr-2DgymbO98wR3Bghw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Virgin and Child", "artist": "Parmigianino", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM--RZ2pl_ugg7S7N4Dpj5zwEzOfd2crItAbdWSwV5UwQaMeWiN-xAupfalEx5tkhXGtuLwC-xRD", "desc": "Girolamo Francesco Maria Mazzola, nicknamed Parmigianino after his hometown of Parma in northern Italy, arrived in Rome in 1524.

The Preparation of Christs Tomb is one of his later works, and is very different from the rest of his \u0153uvre. The austere style and the approach to the familiar theme, equally exceptional in the wealth of allusions and its gloomy mood, make the earlier attribution to Mantegna understandable. The semi-naked old man, crouching and lost in thought at the foot of the tree, can be interpreted as Job, the patient sufferer of the Old Covenant, humble before his God, and thus a familiar archetype for the suffering Christ. At the top left we can make out the crosses of Golgotha, and on the right Christs mourning followers. If the various man-made objects suggest the passing of antiquity, the Renaissance-shaped legs of the table call to mind contemporary forms, and it is a Byzantine pictorial tradition which places Christ ceremonially on a table, where his body can be washed. The anvil-like central support stands for the red stone of unction, a highly revered relic in the Orthodox Church. The melancholy calm of this moment between death an resurrection is underlined by the trumpeter who is playing in the middle of this desolate scene. In another altar-panel, which is now in New York and was probably painted around 1505-07, Carpaccio again placed Job at the side of the dead Christ. Both paintings were in the Canonici collection in Ferrara in 1632. Nevertheless, the closely related theme raises the question of whether, as has recently been suggested, they could both actually have been painted for the Scuola di San Giobbe, which had been re-established after a move in 1504; other accompanying pieces are so far unknown, and the Berlin picture is sometimes dated as late as 1515-20"}, {"title": "Trento, View from the North", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9n47gUAQp8zfFSOgjthLkbJnPnVU-Bvm9dIpyQRg5Ct1L0Yj4m7386tdWCvA8eMSvLvq2a7tmX", "desc": "Prior to World War II, with 48 drawings and watercolors by Albrecht D\u00fcrer and nearly all his printed works, the Department of Prints and Drawings at the Kunsthalle Bremen owned the secondlargest D\u00fcrer collection in Germany, after Berlin.

The three drawings you see here come from the large bequest of Hieronymus Klugkist. They illustrate in an exemplary way D\u00fcrer\u2019s achievement in the German Renaissance as the inventor of the landscape and the nude as independent genres. Trento, View from the North is among the 32 watercolors that have come down to us, that D\u00fcrer created as a young man some time between the years 1494 and 1500, when he also first traveled to Italy (1494\u201395). Whereas here he depicted the northern Italian city in the Etsch Valley as a broad landscape, for the most part, with extremely wet brushstrokes, he worked the large-format plant study Blue Flag Iris in extremely delicate gradations of color, revealing minute details. In Italy, D\u00fcrer\u2019s interest in portraying the human body was also awakened. Back in Nuremberg, he created his famous work The Women\u2019s Bath. Up until this point, nudes had featured exclusively in religious contexts. But D\u00fcrer\u2019s bold drawing, done in his youth, shows a contemporary, private or public bath with six women of varying ages as well as two children. Out of principle, men were not allowed to frequent such places. But here, through a crack in the door, a man catches a glimpse of what is going on. It is not known today whether this pen-and-ink drawing served as a preliminary drawing for a print\u2014it is possible that D\u00fcrer planned to produce a pendant to his large-scale woodcut The Men\u2019s Bath (Inv.

Thus the donor seeking protection at St. Dominic\u2019s elbow at the left edge of the painting remains unidentified. According to the latest research, the picture was painted in Naples rather than in Rome and thus in the period between 1601 and 1605. Its existence is first documented in 1607, when it was already being put up for sale in Naples. The owners, two Dutch art dealers, returned to Amsterdam with the painting sometime before 1617. There it was acquired in 1618/19 by an Antwerp consortium, to which Rubens and Jan Brueghel the EIder belonged, before it finally found a new home in Antwerp\u2019s Dominican Church. In 1781 the Madonna of the Rosary was acquired for the imperial collection of paintings at the instigation of Emperor Joseph II. Pope Gregory XIII instituted the Feast of the Holy Rosary in 1573, following the victory of the allied Christian forces over the Turkish fleet at Lepanto (1571), and entrusted the Dominican order with its observance. St. Peter Martyr, who can be recognised by his wounded head, turns as holy mediator towards the viewer. He indicates to the faithful the presence of the enthroned Madonna with the child Jesus. She, on the other hand, turns to the side, ordering St. Dominic, who is looking up in obedience, to distribute rosaries to the people who are pressing towards him on their knees. But ultimately even Mary plays only the role of a mediator \u2013 the boy Jesus is the focus of attention with regards to both content and composition. As in most of his works, Caravaggio achieves the strong physical presence of the figures in a realistic, never idealising manner through the use of intense contrasts of light and dark. He subtly makes the objects of their desire, the rosaries, more abstract by putting them in the shadows, making the brightly illuminated hands all the more dominant."}, {"title": "Saint Paul preaching in Athens, after Raphael", "artist": "Raffaello Sanzio", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9N8T82wa1LCKj93rbQGtuUpxHLe0xk72rL9Tr5Sg4pBWlMcf0U5OSEcqn6ssYbP84jwnDbYbs", "desc": null}, {"title": "Peasant Family Going to Market", "artist": "Martin Schongauer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9vvUNjMe6muSBfYuuXKgsOhj2Eibi4QF_Vi_TX5c5KKUUZxh0d_WeX1txT899TBNGY6eZjJVc", "desc": null}, {"title": "Madonna and Child in a Window", "artist": "Martin Schongauer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9H1wIua_w8T-pVOxgXOiYAfHdnvqvF-_CEYhinRQa1IutlHEXpso7ofEpuSRxvl-lYfKbupQ", "desc": "Although he was reportedly a prolific painter, this panel is one of only seven paintings by Martin Schongauer in existence today.

Often these pages contained a scattering of sketches on numerous unrelated projects, seemingly the contents of Leonardo\u2019s thoughts poured onto the page. This sheet includes studies for a child with a lamb (on the recto, or front) and studies of machinery (on the verso, or back, or reverse), among other sketches. With limited formal schooling, Leonardo learned through close observation and an insatiable curiosity about how things worked.Between 1503 and 1506, Leonardo used black chalk, pen and ink to draw a child and a lamb multiple times, trying out different poses for the figures. He began with many quick sketches in chalk. He then went over some of these in pen and ink, firming up his ideas, as at upper right. The most evolved study is that at center left, in which the child leans back on the lamb, the group rendered more completely in space. Sheets of drawings such as this allowed Renaissance artists to experiment with complex compositions, poses, gestures, and expressions before committing them to wood panel or canvas with paint. As such, drawings were rarely meant to be viewed as finished objects in their own right.Leonardo probably made the drawing in preparation for a painting of the Virgin and Child with Saint John, now lost but known through copies. He inscribed some unrelated notes concerning a treatise on geometry at the top of the sheet in his characteristic backwards writing, legible only with the help of a mirror. Some speculated that this right-to-left writing was meant to conceal his ideas, but this is not in fact any kind of da Vinci code. Because he was left-handed, writing in the opposite direction saved Leonardo from smearing ink as his hand moved across the paper.

In contrast to other drawings debatably attributed to Mantegna, the heightening in white in this work is not characterized by dense and painstaking sketching, but rather by lightness of touch and restraint. An even more striking feature is the subtle distinctions in the modelling of light and shade, which here are not unfeelingly situated in direct juxtaposition with one another, but are instead gradated to create a seamless chiaroscuro of utmost subtlety in both the clothing and the naked areas of body.

Born in Heemixen, near Antwerp, the painter treats his figures in a way that reflects his time spent in Italy, securing his place among the Dutch \"Romanists\". His work, painted in 1540, offers a view into a locale, which closer inspection reveals to be a brothel - the bird-cage in front of the door being only one indicator. Close to the viewer, virtually at the front, on the apron of the stage-like space of the painting, the artist has arranged three nearly life-sized figures: an older man with striking features and a red hat, a young woman with light colouring, who lays her hand on his shoulder and seeks his attention, and an ugly older woman with a furrowed face, who gestures to a pitcher of wine and also tries to seduce the guest. The man, however, a wayfarer with a bag and a sword, raises his right hand defensively, apparently intending to stand up. A wine glass stands on a pile of playing cards on the table.The guest apparently resists being seduced into frivolity, wastefulness, and impurity by the lures of alcohol and gambling. In side scenes in the upper corners of the painting, a sailor is being coerced into entering the locale of \"Venus and her followers\". On the right, a lad has fallen victim to four strumpets who surround him, one of whom has already taken possession of his wallet. The depiction of the small figures is probably not the work of Hemessen himself, but rather of the so-called Monogramist of Braunschweig, who is known as the inventor of brothel and tavern paintines. Hemessens painting is characterized by enthusiasm for drastically exaggerated figures, dramatic contrast of light and dark, and the meticulousness typical of the Old Masters.

In 1467 he was accepted by the citys painters\u2019 guild as a free master and, by 1473, he was dean of the guild. At the height of his fame, in 1477, he retreated to the monastery of Roodendaele near Brussels. Despite the severe mental illness that clouded his later years he continued to work as a painter. Van der Goess artistic achievement is all the more remarkable because his entire output is concentrated within a period of only fifteen years. He produced works of art that are among the most remarkable achievements of late 15th-century Netherlandish art in their expressive and monumental qualities. The Adoration of the Kings was the central panel to a large triptych. Old copies show that the wings depicted the birth and circumcision of Christ. The works altered state can be seen from the loss of the wings, and the fact that the central panel has been cut down: it used to have a raised rectangular section in the centre. The altars appellation derives from its stay in the monastery of Monforte de Lemos in northern Spain, where it was presumably taken in the 16th century. The patron and the altars original purpose are unknown. The Adoration of the Kings is one of Hugo van der Goess earliest large works. Mary is sitting in front of a palace-like building with the child on her lap. Joseph is kneeling beside her, greeting the kings from the East. These representatives of the three realms of the world have gathered reverently with their gifts to pay tribute to the new ruler of the world. The figures in the picture are true to life to an extent that goes far beyond anything achieved in Netherlandish art until that time. The theme of the Adoration has seldom been so movingly recreated. The rendering of the costly fabrics and objects, the richness of the colours and the immediacy of the event give this part of the mystery of salvation a closeness to the present that its contemporary viewers must have perceived as a sign of the living significance of the events portrayed"}, {"title": "Mrs Jane Small, formerly Mrs Pemberton", "artist": " http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O16583", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_84y3NWc8jmuZHZdzxyqcgk8AQGNTQjAgwLeIiR66dP8WiTk6aXVtbrEDSp6vAB6dRUEp4BzM", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Surgeon", "artist": "Lucas van Leyden", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Nh5qBLBTek6LIbX4INqOeiItAkGUV7ZFHK1fZDT7Ygcl0rFVzIDbNZ6yw0GuVKj55gXN-ktdV", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ecce Homo", "artist": "Jos\u00e9 de Ribera", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9CwNtYKS_fSyG7QXHogS6dzH3l0Uxqd2uNNsymlUBQwmbj04Xj5-PXqS0EdfkUPQkLGTj_4ys", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Ghent Altarpiece: Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, detail of female saints, martyrs and confessors.", "artist": "Jan Van Eyck", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_cBVxHxneTET1i86BxaG-OhbMhWXcciC5BWUTy-Uons_4CXlYHHMTacaDf92MA_c2L3o_d8Kxp", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Eustace", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_D87bcB40pRAhIvafyhiS_bAFGTXthLcSZz_1pRI8aZ9bqnWf0bL_gXiA9lF75XTFMD7nj4OCl", "desc": null}, {"title": "Temptation of Saint Anothony", "artist": "Hieronymus Bosch", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8rX25yYC97xaipn0AVAFfO_9VL32fjDbl4c4koxBpILZyhQfuIIuKJdAS7nMKVsC0QLIO7TWI", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Artist's Sister Minerva Anguissola", "artist": "Sofonisba Anguissola", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8N_6frlKOQtTl9WkfhayVINBdfI4in3TBapsswF-x-16nk2PRBozWkYxvxpGRRYUZUbgqUFQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Mocking of Christ: title page for the Large Passion", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8zYn5ARatbrS1eMY3IuhbwUwfvHABbguWNfIKd2qILIJJyJxnPuTy7LCeiCrajz8bs9f-kKg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Dianae Ephesiae Templum (The Temple of Diana at Ephesus)", "artist": "Philip Galle", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8YKU7jye--mqFv4a2HCw1yIqrvd-mJJmVXAEJ5OvM9GBdxFvQxCKDPekXubizzaS4kh7ExzQQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Triumphal Procession of Bacchus", "artist": "Maerten van Heemskerck", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_abSyo0gKenTu64vzjomVhd4vHvaLAhR2w9OeDMAoQZ3CUKPInoRRYW8dh850s38yFandOPA", "desc": "On his many journeys, Bacchus (Greek: Dionysus), the Greek and Roman god of wine and fertility, was accompanied by Maenads and Satyrs, his attribute the panther, and goats. Together, they indulged themselves in an ecstasy stimulated by wine and dance. In the art of classical antiquity, the wine-god\u2019s outward appearance as a nude, soft and often drunken ruler became early established. The present painting in landscape format shows Bacchus as the main figure in a triumphal procession. He is to proceed through the arch visible at the left edge of the painting on his way to his final destination, the round temple situated on a hill in the background. Bacchus is seated in the chariot, enthroned atop a wine barrel. His entourage is equally intoxicated; even the animal pulling the chariot is no longer up to its task. Beneath the animal, a Satyr has fallen to the ground and vomited; a mirror held by a gleeful child reveals the mishap to the viewer. Further to the front of the procession dancers and acrobatics are the centre of attention. The dark-skinned figures are a reference to the mythical journey of Bacchus to India but also serve to punctuate the lighter brown shades used by the artist with varying intensity. Details depicted in their full materiality, such as the Maenads\u2019 thyrsus (a staff wrapped in leafy vine and ivy), the drinking vessel in the wine-god\u2019s left hand, wine jars, musical instruments and piecesof jewellery as well as the architectural elements provide the necessary compositional counterbalance to the soft fleshy depictions of the figures.Maerten van Heemskerck was part of a second generation of Netherlandishpainters who made extensive study visits to Rome. The impressions he gained there are clearly visible in the present painting: the foot of a colossal statue in the foreground on the left, the Satyr figures at the arch and the round temple in the background are based on classical models"}, {"title": "Three German Soldiers Armed with Halberds", "artist": "Daniel Hopfer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_DtvsxhKK_d-7atvt_qHYTi9FA40lqNp4qF4eDddgKz9xcTh8YDoReVwyWrH52MPC8bGGq4pWx", "desc": null}, {"title": "Expiring Crucified Christ", "artist": "Oil on canvas", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-Cu9A01hbIiLA4as-2fHt3ph2Hy0r86OY4ya1LDn2x23luhlrgG0GL8QzBBAJh_ODhOzkHvy0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hercules at the Crossroad", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9VIDIi3zHOrfQ38YfASBV5az0CdOB_NVUTnmvfWYwTPF3VBr4IjXl0UMDN-uJd0_1D6_WJ3Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "Rondanini Piet\u00e0", "artist": "Michelangelo Buonarroti", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM92CiiFDFLVww1e0W6BjTDehYI06M9YJQCJHA6zfEqZnwwC7uWdDPgHOzThouQzIoKLAqlrfQ", "desc": "The Rondanini Piet\u00e0 is the last sculpture by Michelangelo, who worked on it until the last days of his life. The iconography of the Piet\u00e0 is of northern provenance: and portrays the Madonna holding the dead body of Jesus Christ after the deposition from the cross. The theme is present throughout Michelangelo\u2019s life, from the Piet\u00e0 (Vatican City, St. Peters Basilica) produced during his youth, to the mature and complex Bandini Piet\u00e0 (Florence, Museo dell\u2019Opera del Duomo), which he created in the mid-1500s and destroyed around 1555. Following this episode, he started carving the marble that would yield the Rondanini Piet\u00e0. Unrestrained by requests that could be made by a client and free to work for himself, Michelangelo limits the number of figures to the Mother and Son, both standing,. A first version of the group can be observed in drawings and in some highly finished areas of the marble, such as the legs and right arm, which is detached from the body. At a later date\u00a0, the sculptor decided to modify the group by reprocessing the marble and enhancing the slenderness of the figures, which become more delicate and finer. Direct work on the marble continues until a few days before the artist\u2019s death in Rome in 1564, at the age of almost ninety. The sculpture still presents signs of intensive processing and thus remains impressively unfinished. Reported as present in the sculptor\u2019s workshop after his death, it reappeared only in 1807, in the Roman Palace of Marquis Rondinini (hence the name, later distorted into Rondanini). It is only since the early 1900s that the sculpture awoke the interest of scholars as a genuine masterpiece that was consistent with the taste of the emerging Expressionism. The most significant part of the work\u2019s ascent into the limelight was its purchase by the Milan Municipality in 1952, also with public donations. the sculpture was finally assigned to the Sforza Castle\u2019s museums. In a city that was still marked by the bomb attacks of 1943, Milanese citizens considered the purchase a cultural rebirth"}, {"title": "Portrait of a Young Man", "artist": "Antonello da Messina", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_B6Z_psAcFOek85jemRqRvxYLW368RxBxM50nlnfEzw_LMA2tVymNS1JgXUYehDuK8jDNpVQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Gesetz und Gnade", "artist": null, "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8V0Wz_OSXlaMWVcUzCgYwVNoAJxboFFWpQ35y1wv-HIvXK_6uS50UL3H-_VksEPJ8r4x_2_w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landscape with Acis and Galatea", "artist": "Claude Lorrain", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_yEKEzkxeKCbpqKHyp9VCVg6UZetjQjx15sA5N-lq5HDo1bUr0Wa_sG2B2jX8GXQz8IIyjNY0", "desc": "In this painting Claude Lorraine has completely marginalized the biblical subject.

The body of the Philistine Goliath slain by David and fleeing Philistine troops can be seen in the left background, all depicted in such an energetic manner that Sir K. Clark noted, \"they bring to mind Delacroix.\" Two theories have been proposed for the dating of this work: E. von der Bercken suggests the period of 1544-1550, while R. Pallucchini and P. Rossi indicate the latter half of the 1550s. It would seem that the latter theory is correct. It is thought that the figure shown is the scion, appropriately named David, of a famous family. This individual is thought to be the same figure shown in Paolo Veroneses work Man in Furs (Museum of Fine Arts Budapest). While O. Benesch has proposed that Tintorettos followers student, the Flemish painter Gillis van Valckenborch, added the scene of the Philistine battle, Rossi rejects this theory.(Source: Masterpieces of the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, 2009, cat. no. 18"}, {"title": "The Madonna on the Grassy Bank", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM--d5scfk-x_8eoO__A1ge8HBA3J-l-FFeTFjIiUPoWHmpFu5BL9LVhotVyOH9jLWsev8xqWyk6", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Man of Sorrows Seated", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8uKnXgS5T_KH_r02HnVBjWoZqJOVdpE17djy3bYMzyjkHkDFQ5r09M6HZW4FfZrjuTHmHBZg", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Holy Family with the Three Hares", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_-HIbXF4ymy9GcvUV3K1lNWlqihIN4jvqhVtT1WlkXCPQS-Oyixml6HkCrr6CR8Ti0yqyMEw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Madame Anne-Henriette de France - The Fire", "artist": "Jean-Marc Nattier", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-g5l83jJwWmK5VdZjZjp3oSte6txAlrkjZ8a5IwMnRbHfbeTLzKr62wxahd92iAl7LenOmOGZh", "desc": null}, {"title": "Two Nudes Fighting", "artist": "Michelangelo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8P1DA1g9Av_8QmdiTYzUyybuMXs3cuZnbeqcsjOyHND_ubXaBGnTX1icu27vmMeFE951My03k", "desc": null}, {"title": "St. Giuseppe da Leonessa and St.Fedele da Sigmaringen Stepping on Heresy", "artist": "Giambattista Tiepolo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9hNpLgyTKJU0VKR2GA0g3e2Q1f6PbisFmCMEKsKLFTgsOyQwo6mg9dZVaav30X77Pv3U_H7g", "desc": "Come le tele di Pittoni e di Piazzetta, il dipinto proviene dalla chiesa dei Cappuccini a Parma, ove venne ricordato da una guida locale, collocato nella quarta ed ultima cappella a destra.

They sadly told him that Jesus grave had been found empty. With a measure of tension, liveliness, and poignancy unprecedented in Venetian painting, Tintorettos work illustrates the moment when the disciples first recognize their master. To quote from the Gospel account (Luke 24:30-31): \"When he was at table with them, He [Jesus] took bread and blessed and brake and gave to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished out of their sight.\" Faithful to the Scripture, Jesus, while blessing the bread, is no longer corporeally present: he dissolves into an apparition. The pilgrim sitting with his back to us gesticulates wildly as if wanting to seize the disappearing vision, while his companion, shown facing the viewer, is turning toward the bearded old man, spreading out his arms in awe of the miracle. The other figures - the innkeeper offering fish to Christ on a dish and the servant girl proffering wine to a youth - remain unaware of the miracle, as their gestures indicate; although they are present, it eludes them. The basic composition still conforms to the High Renaissance norm: the scene takes place in an enclosed space parallel to the picture plane, defined by a checkered stone floor across the foreground. Christs place on the central axis is reiterated by the column over his head and the corner of the table. The two groups of three figures flanking Christ are regulated by the classical system of contrasting counterbalances. This compositional scheme, based on equal bilateral groupings is, however, shattered by the agitated movement of the figures to either side of Christ. The rough, broken brushstrokes, drawn with incredible vigor, emphasize the twisting postures of the disciples. Although the colors are typically Venetian, Tintoretto applies them to characterize figures that are Michelangelesque in energy and plasticity. Unlike Veronese, whose elegant style enthralls the viewer, Tintoretto utilized the theatrical nature of his compositions to command the viewer to witness the miraculous and supernatural. The Budapest painting is generally assumed to predate the masters earliest documented work, the Last Supper of 1547 in the Scuola di San Marcuola. Scholars suggest a date around 1542, making the picture one of the young Tintorettos most important early works."}, {"title": "Saint Andrew", "artist": "Lucas Cranach the Elder", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Ob1v-rxaJIvMnNhADjB3aYAtIv0woMeoPn7WmNm7NgEM2Tv4sjTzpyrQGJ8ozDjhuhqgPcKXW", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of the Duchess of Parma and her Daughter Isabelle", "artist": "Jean-Marc Nattier", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-0lSEsDjfoQquMllhVJXfRH7gBOoICfx1MJA14bdn-OZCqmnvTA6l8wa-N8DFh_OT2eYNtVJU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Adam and Eve flanked by two trees, a town in the background", "artist": "Marcantonio Raimondi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_8INuVDQAtf3WULn_Eyg8kZS-z12wLCiqRJjK6u2L9AHO8hA6t38hHO0aaUv9UiVjLN-RxkA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Study of a Mourning Woman", "artist": "Michelangelo Buonarroti", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9dwjyrk2UktK9m5DSyKW6VScVwCAqjaJuzKEiPnbj1gKb_C5IAgGImJzvj5l3SPIPG0L3iKQ", "desc": "This powerful study of a mourning woman encapsulates Michelangelo\u2019s extraordinary talent for monumental figural conceptions. It is characterized by dense crosshatching in pen and brown ink (a technique he learned from his time in the studio of Domenico Ghirlandaio), creating a solid form that is sculptural in effect; indeed the hatched penwork recalls Michelangelo\u2019s use of the claw chisel to model the surfaces of his marble sculptures. Combining elements of both his early copies and his more dynamic original preparatory studies datable to the early 1500s, the Mourning Woman documents Michelangelo\u2019s shift from his youthful studies to his iconic independent works, notably the Florentine Battle of Cascina mural project of c. 1504. The figure appears to be dressed in a peplum, a full-length robe worn by women of antiquity as depicted in Renaissance painting. The pose and attitude of the woman is one that would typically have been found in a composition of the Deposition from the Cross or a Lamentation. No such project is known to have been undertaken by Michelangelo at this stage of his career yet early copies of this drawing indicate such a possibility. Michelangelo\u2019s Mourning Woman was discovered in 1995 by Sotheby\u2019s specialist Julien Stock within an album of otherwise nondescript drawings in the library of Castle Howard, Yorkshire, England.

Lecchini Giovannoni (1991) associated this note with the present painting and two (unsigned) others (in the Seminario Patriarcale, Venice, and sold Sothebys, New York, January 22, 2004, lot 17, respectively), which are identical in size and composition. While the Medicean provenance of any of the surviving paintings can not be positively proven, the identification certainly seems very likely: not only do the measurements correspond closely (a Florentine braccio being equivalent to 58.4 cm), but stylistic characteristics also suggest a dating to the early 1590s. A reason for the rather odd fact that three, virtually identical versions of the same composition were kept in the same collection at the same time is hard to find, but the proposal of Alessandro Cecchi that they may have been intended as diplomatic gifts sounds convincing. The suggestion is supported by the fact that by 1596 only one of the coppers remained in the Medici palace. Vilmos T\u00e1trai has pointed out that Alloris painting, in subject as well as composition, derives from the Byzantine type of the icon of Christs death, the Epitaphios, which represents the corpse of Christ laid out in readiness for the unction, with two angels performing the rites of death. In this context the mattress, upholstered in red velvet, stands for the \"red stone\", that is, the holy Stone of Unction venerated in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem: according to tradition, Christs body was anointed lying on this red marble slab. The icon of the dead Christ laid on the Stone of Unction alludes to the Eucharist, too: the transubstantiation of Christs flesh and blood into consecrated bread and wine over the altar. The connotation is reinforced here by the communion table in the background, with pyxes and a chalice atop. It is very rare for a late-sixteenth-century Florentine painting to follow a Byzantine iconography. It might be related to the very close relations between the Florentine and the Spanish courts in those days. The King of Spain, being the most devoted champion of the Catholic Counter-Reformation movement, also bore the title of the king of Jerusalem, and in this role he keenly promoted a major redecoration of the chapel of the Stone of Unction. It may worth noting that Allori himself was also involved in this project, painting an image of the resurrected Christ with two angels for the chapel"}, {"title": "The Peasant Couple at Market", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-4y5_sF4826uXVuEF18AJ_19DtpPgn00Mtf_h2rOGB2yY5dnjGa7mIIHUthRemLg4Joh0_FbuE", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Battle of the Sea Gods (the Left Half)", "artist": "Andrea Mantegna", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8OyAA46Jq5mL60MZKA9U43TVc7l39q3Y3li5lwGOgisOQSuFNv8_AGXXr6yINkHFzvFZzsCi5l", "desc": "Mantegna is a famous painter of 15th century Italy.

It shows the sun god Apollo, admired for his moral standing and physical beauty, and his twin sister Diana or Artemis, goddess of the moon, who was associated with chastity, archery and hunting. The emphasis on humanity closely related to the primeval forest and hunting recalls Cranachs earlier work and the so-called Danube School. Apollo and Diana is given a particular intensity by the way in which the figures are seen in relief but also related to the forest behind them. Dianas precisely rendered hair curls around the stags antlers, which in turn are deliberately confused with the branches of the trees behind. Cranachs characteristically incisive clarity and attention to minute detail is seen here - for example, in the reflected light in the stags eye or the small swans swimming on the lake. Cranach may have already encountered the subject in Vienna. On 1 March 1501 the Emperor Frederick III and members of the nobility attended a performance of Ludus Dianae, a play by the humanist Conrad Celtis. In the court and scholarly circles in which Cranach moved at Wittenberg, Apollo would probably have been regarded as a forerunner of Christ and chaste Diana of the Virgin Mary, as well as mythological heroes. The decorative schemes at Wittenberg which have not survived brought together biblical, classical and mythological stories. Dianas pose echoes that of the Antique bronze known as the Spinario (the thorn-remover, which shows a small boy pulling a thorn from the sole of his foot), though this source is much more apparent in a slightly later version in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Brussels. Cranach also took ideas from prints of same subject by Jacopo deBarbari and by D\u00fcrer, both dated c.1502-3, creating a new interpretation from these sources. In the final painting Cranach made very slight alterations to some contours for example, Adams legs, and his eyes and eyebrows, which were raised to be visible above the feathers of the arrow. Prince Albert bought the painting as Adam and Eve, which is understandable since the protagonists have no obvious attributes and as nude types are very like those of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, a subject which Cranach painted with many variations. Cranach intermingled sacred and secular motifs. A drawing of Adam and Eve (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam) may represent an intermediary stage between the Courtauld Adam and Eve and this painting. In it Eve is seated on a stag in a pose similar to that of Diana here. It is possible that Apollo and Diana and A Faun and his Family (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) were painted as a pair because of similarities in composition, size and support. They may have been part of a larger group, painted c.1526, which formed a decorative scheme that included Adam and Eve (Courtauld Institute Gallery, London, dated 1526) and Cupid Complaining to Venus (National Gallery, London). The two later autograph versions of Apollo and Diana in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin, dated 1530, and in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, are each subtly different, illustrating the way in which Cranachs successful workshop varied ideas without exact repetition.

No. 5), in which the figures were depicted in an architectural setting. The new type was often in landscape format and set outdoors under an open sky. There are several examples of this in Lotto\u2019s work, which was inspired in particular by Palma Vecchio, with whom Lotto was on friendly terms, according to the artists\u2019 biographer Vasari. Palma Vecchio had abandoned the conventional hierarchic arrangement offigures and developed more intimate compositions seen from a closer distance. Lotto, who was considered the most individualist of the Venetian artists of his generation, continued these tendencies. In their gestures, glances and posture, his figures were much closer together than those of the painters before him. The backdrop of the picture is a gently illuminated landscape in the distance. Mary and the Child, Catherine, Thomas and an angel are seated in the shadow of a tree. Lotto decisively changes the time-honoured type: the picture is marked not by the tranquillity of the High Renaissance but by the sensitive expressiveness of early Mannerism. A continuous and nervous stream of movement sweeps across the picture, from the arms of the angel crowning the Madonna to the hand of the Child reaching for the book to the head of Catherine as she looks towards the devout Apostle, who with his intimate eye contact with Mary leads the viewer back to the Virgin. The cool and scarcely Venetian coloration \u2013 found throughout Lotto\u2019s work \u2013 is rooted in the painting of Bergamo, where he spent most of his life, but also in the art of D\u00fcrer."}, {"title": "Ghent Altarpiece: portrait of Joos Vijd", "artist": "Jan", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM__dQoWMWP3s8zqvzmbJHrgn-khNO2uKSB2VNVuLTor0_q-8qF-VLycaGcM1Rs4dtqOYVhbsg", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Little Horse", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM89O0fllcrexjurtD69EqlkrXvIhimz6tOeWDrEqNCm_fPmNgkLhohVeHA8gUn7TTY04IlXhQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Zondeval van Adam en Eva bij boom van kennis van goed en kwaad met slang", "artist": "Raimondi, Marcantonio", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-iyRABeCEGOzzr2LQuKg34KM0ZVhRF5K5XjUW_d9sZItaFOIh2d-pqazIBae1u6GKBKBtn6Os", "desc": null}, {"title": "Amnon Attacking Tamar", "artist": "Jan van Dornicke", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8hF5-PUI-JAxN4zMo0p-kYdSv_tgBZurz1eoDwjy7sAnqWeU0KgUWW350sjH9fqrhfpaKn-gg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Avarice (Avaritia), from the series The Seven Deadly Sins", "artist": "Pieter Bruegel the Elder", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_kR_1J9y-OokY_H7hiezA65GGwo8cByx5AhdiCt0V7OyoJ7WRvFDSZyqZ_1SG8NCAFq2daiQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Peasant and His Wife", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9-4rBYngvfwIjDKSKHOnT09hvsFQHimxLSLIvp7XcpKsrg_sfbXvWsERyodm7ebdC4Gpo8iQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Dream of the Doctor", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8qI-QeXnjZgxc9AjUu6NUBErQk9Fet_6QAJQzR1P9vwD9w2CVT8ngCVrx0SuhO7lY4RpNUTaU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christ on the Mount of Olives", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8kxvFQoxQezHEluRa03OeZTtdm9TWhkYuuXUwP16VxNzHWHpuEgBE3qgQU7e9p3gDZIwYfSA2T", "desc": null}, {"title": "Capture of Porto Ercole", "artist": "Giorgio Vasari", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_qHx-jdmv223dTRcCdkuFY6Z5XD5BAjqeGVIsf-Gf1LLzxMD76poHISM_kZUPvxxzGwYld", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Enclosed Valley", "artist": "Hercules Seghers", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_kGdgpaGd0AfOfn8-3JgdgKZj3r97ihvl0JfKxUUxUqJEBmNdXYonhEV1iYAqi37zlPEbvRTI", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Satyr Family", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Fh7U_lLuD6dQh-MkfwXf2_suY1191Pt6Oj0Pb09cKZyacPZfMh-Vwrr9Gems2W1SMdA3Uq8w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Virgin and Child on the Crescent with a Diadem", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM98IPHawcPIOf6gDPZNA7iFzJ2_25JaqGMx9TYuydLhdQ6U8mSSqeogCzCxIYqbqZImknonFg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Bust-length image of an old man with fur collar and hat", "artist": "Martin Schongauer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8SBt-Rk-CzVaMINkOtE72FoZnCZ3jN-HxkIp6fMf9x1zEYIIp2PzI_FvOk-LcDw8u7A3EUx60", "desc": "This work seems to be a portrait drawn from life.

"Lucas Cranach the Elder drew from both native German and classical literary sources to depict a family of fauns in a woodland clearing. Although the precise subject of this painting remains obscure, it recalls the legendary \"wild man\" found in medieval mythology, as well as idyllic forest dwellers, such as fauns, described in Greek poetry.    The male faun sits on a rock, staff in hand, with a slain lion at his feet. He gazes toward a woman--presumably his wife--and their children. Dark foliage mediates between them and a stunning landscape: a lake, a village, mountains, and a castle in the distance. Isolated and protected from civilization, these figures represent the wild traits of mankind. On the other hand, the fauns humanlike appearance, the womans calm demeanor, and the babys tender gesture suggest more civilized aspects of society.   Aside from this broader narrative, Cranachs finely worked style draws attention to incidental elements, such as the lions fur and a man and a horse and cart climbing the castle-topped mountain. The lions stylized body fits perfectly in the paintings lower left corner.

The scene is situated under a scallop that acts as an arcade. The center of the composition is the elegant and serene figure of the Virgin, adorned with a headdress of classic reminiscence, holding on her lap a robust Child that shows his sexuality as symbol of the human condition. Using a medieval tendency, both figures are bigger in size to emphasize their hierarchy. To the left, Saint Joseph contrasts with his calm stance but not without grandeur, the Three Wise Men with their energetic adoration. The figures, with defined volumes stand out for their monumental appearance. The work is structured in two differentiated groups that establish a connection through glances and gestures. Like this, a diagonal links Saint Joseph, the Child and Melchiors heads while the Virgin is linked to Balthazar. The density of the elements and figures in a minimal space, which forces the positions, and the mastery of figuration in emptiness, separate this work from renaissance postulates and clearly put it within the Mannerism movement. Chromatically this is a very warm piece with predominance of gold and ochre or pink from the flesh. The figures are outlined over the rich polychromy of the estofado technique and the base of the relief"}, {"title": "Alexander the Great and Bucephalus", "artist": "Taddeo Zuccaro", "img_url":

Murillo clearly surpasses an altar-panel painted by Rubens in Mechelen, which is known to us from drawings and to which Murillos composition owes a great deal, particularly in the naturalness of the pictorial structure with the two life-size figures.

Patinier\u2019s landscapes are serious and strict in their composition, never realistic. They are characterised by bizarre, sometimes even geologically impossible cliff formations and cool coloration. The Baptism of Christ is one of the major works by the Antwerp painter, who sometimes seems to have been influenced by Hieronymus Bosch and also adapted compositions by Gerard David to his purposes. Here he observes the tradition of an axial structure, with God the Father in the clouds, the Dove of the Holy Spirit and the Baptism of Christ. In the middle distance we see a sermon by John the Baptist. Christ is listening from a distance, still wearing the blue garment that he has laid aside in the foreground. The religious scene and the depiction of a magnificent landscape seem to balance one another \u2013 an innovation that influenced the entire development of Flemish landscape painting.

Titian and his workshop created many copies and variations of this composition, at least seven of which are known today. This work is likely to have been executed with some workshop assistance. In this variation, the artist omits the skull which appears in other compositions, and instead depicts the Magdalenes Bible resting on a cloth-covered support. Such minor alterations to compositions were often made at the request of a patron, who wanted a work similar to one which already existed, but unique in some way.The sacrament of Penance had important significance in Counter-Reformation spirituality, and artists frequently portrayed penitent saints as exemplars of religious fervor. Such works were meant to inspire a greater devotion at a time when Catholicism was being challenged by Protestant reform. On the other hand, the popularity of The Magdalene as a subject is also associated with her implied sexuality. Her passive gaze and partially naked body appealed to male viewers, for whom such paintings offered a moralizing context through which to engage with the sensuality of the female form. The Magdalene\u2019s partly exposed breasts and long, flowing hair, would have held erotic connotations for the sixteenth-century viewer. Upon encountering one of Titian\u2019s conceptions of the Penitent Magdalene, biographer Giorgio Vasari (1511\u20131574) denied such sexual undertones, and declared that the picture \u201cprofoundly stirs the emotions of all who look at it; and, moreover, although the figure Mary Magdalene is extremely lovely it moves one to thoughts of pity rather than desire.\u201dX-rays of the painting reveal that the artist made numerous changes to the composition, known as pentimenti, suggesting that the composition was developed and altered during its execution"}, {"title": "Christ in Limbo", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-lhY5qzj83Egjg8qugBEKlnrUk5-DlqrpQvrOUvpQE9IAvtjIQaD41QzLFyi6QmKCc39WVfQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Return of the Prodigal Son", "artist": "Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-NWIo-GyYJfny3xru9s0MVp_xT0Q5wthSnfwjiM9MWveXda7uuFaKb0QejPKfIHiHpJT-AZV4", "desc": null}, {"title": "Het martelaarschap van Sint-Laurentius, met twee benedictinessen", "artist": "Jacobello del Fiore", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_SLIsmDtllbJfTGrePxsSoBTZ5i3lv4qrxeZ-GZgK9S_5xVVeLqn8tWqaKA8-3ZedeYlyLVJTs", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Vision of Saint Francis of Paola", "artist": "Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-WA795o3Ml5TVxRh-LhzG4OTqEfUWni-litkfPP6iAP-f99Zd-ZZzSG36WYLjH-9Et74KPCoQ", "desc": "This painting depicts the heavenly vision of Saint Francis of Paola (1416\u20131507), founder of the Order of Minims, a religious order committed to perpetual abstinence and acts of humility.

In Borromeo\u2019s philosophical-theological view, these paintings went well beyond their secular significance and acquired a profound religious value, since Nature was the book written by God, so that man could rise up from Creation to its Creator.

The Allegory of Earth and the Allegory of Air are now in the Louvre, from which they have never been returned, in spite of the 1815 agreements.The painting is remarkable for the richness of its natural landscape, it was sent by Brueghel to Cardinal Federico in 1614 and was the third in the series"}, {"title": "La Toilette, oil on canvas", "artist": "Francois Boucher", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-yFr7hc6DbzHbWww6TTjvenj1ME-gDaVvpNS94nSz78jVruRdrfJ0HzV1KFya30Z2DLAO1DA", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Lady and Death", "artist": "Sebald Beham", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8S6DPuNcgo_a89_6b1gvwhMtsLYxXHXJV3FlL2GaURI7qgGO2RqL2eOiyWSnibiOFb3JVGFjCj", "desc": null}, {"title": "Avarice (Avaritia) from the series The Seven Deadly Sins", "artist": "Pieter van der Heyden", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9kFemW3Wl7l0LVFhCKbmG8VX-TYfaI0I5eRWoSz80SWXgl2EJv6Qs1kyRAQYEkADxbB0SRuEg", "desc": null}, {"title": "River Landscape", "artist": "Jan Brueghel the Elder", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_q4zaWukFz7XoZIxe_no_ao7bQVf3XU2w8oe2BlFEr2J6wHNWNtkFblvTgf1ZfeE2lPBcy", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Kermis at Hoboken", "artist": "Pieter Bruegel the Elder", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_eLhll9F4uA1pYIZ4-jghl-1XbZus-5VGZVLUbuXPir7Yb2X68yqciWoXTUWUyQoeCzo_XfeQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ornament Design with Crayfish Motif, pl. 14 in Livre des L\u00e9gumes [Series of Vegetable Ornament]pl. in Oeuvre de Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier", "artist": "Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_fHeDznxBbRlZb6V-bC9bdlvjOe052688fNZrJ4THlidsknGhOZ9Hqvyndc8AHVHJ6icJCrEE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christ Carrying the Cross", "artist": "El Greco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8EM-YZx4ZgyToxmcKGpVvwxQilwsNDutWP0o1A3pH2yPV0Ow0imJ43JhCj22xMfLi9NPOesQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Ghent Altarpiece: Angels playing music", "artist": "Jan Van Eyck", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8y7Lyz8jDQMeC0EMmmwqd-xx4x1qQ0RGhEAPhum3rC-LI4QgAggT-7DO38PZGN3efxr03UJHs", "desc": null}, {"title": "Self-Portrait", "artist": "Oil on Canvas", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9cDeuiKtKXOG-gao736HBSdtWHro5BnmIn00aOgy5V672ZORqICm62rJGqi9DkVOJ93ePmXA", "desc": "This artist from Urbino is one of the pioneers of Italian Baroque in the last third of the 16th century"}, {"title": "Bacchanaal met Silenus", "artist": "Mantegna, Andrea", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_3VnOwZOmUkoZ0xgkl4px4BUOSfODXDO4NQAZqzlCilVBvpS3n4Kh4rB2FCPfzcTui9RBR0lE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Margaret of Cortona", "artist": "Gaspare Traversi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-JosyJjNkNziNn4IUJSnuwCzmWamNOIdO0nPgJ3ZY2NtV4OLpUvC6--odOvsJluAgvmHxHDA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Doors of an altarpiece with scenes of saint Catherine's life", "artist": "Pedro Berruguete", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_pOdTwCsWn5vCQZ06U8OKDX6K9ovE3mRQjfJAYU-Nhn2IRk9ERsGJJUJLKXqZG2bI06tP2sumk", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Lute Player and the Harpist", "artist": "Israhel van Meckenem", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8yK4Vye-adEPRxNl_eE8dWGHmqkyxeVyxJaj-BAiXeRHoGtneA5yN18nnQqXH53_sJ2P-uUBgX", "desc": null}, {"title": "Elisabeth of France, Queen of Spain, known as Isabella of Peace", "artist": "Fran\u00e7ois Clouet", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-arY0L1NQ986mVYgdY-LgbpbXsJp5T6EfuEF59G3DZogas_czL-Olifpf1GY_02drVVclcN7k", "desc": null}, {"title": "Guillaume Bud\u00e9 (1467\u20131540)", "artist": "Jean Clouet", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-cNDn_exg_oedzm3SWVA6stZABNZvn5BGaqvTRI70GUw_v2qghxvDUKEmTxRrnzieHAJ7LZJU", "desc": "Painter to King Francis I, Jean Clouet played a key role in establishing the Renaissance portraiture tradition in France, yet this is his only extant painted portrait.

Noli me tangere is the Latin for touch me not, the words spoken to Mary Magdalene by Christ after she discovers him risen from the tomb (Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father John 20: 17). Holbeins unusual depiction focuses on the moment when the mourning Magdalen, having found two angels in the empty place of Christs body at the tomb, turns and encounters a man whom she takes to be a gardener. The majority of Holbeins religious paintings were intended as large altarpieces. This is a smaller, more intimate narrative scene. Mary Magdalene pivots dramatically, her right hand outstretched as though to prevent collision with the man before her. Christ in turn holds out both arms to stop her progress, seemingly in an attempt to soothe her before the moment of recognition. The result is a graceful pas de deux. The colours of her dark cloak and red robe are reversed in the figure of Christ so that the two become negatives of one another. These colours and the poses of the principal figures are echoed by Saints Peter and John in the middle distance who are shown striding towards the city of Jerusalem in the distance in order to announce their discovery of the empty tomb. Light is crucial to the narrative. Silhouetted against the dawn sky on the left are numerous crosses on the hill of Calvary. Also lit and isolated at the centre of the scene are the hands of Christ and the Magdalen. The dawn light has yet to reach the inky darkness above the figures and while Christs face is in full light, Marys face is in half shadow, increasing the sense of confusion expressed in her eyes, showing a doubt and sadness which will soon be replaced by the clear dawn light and the certainty of the Resurrection. In the interior of the tomb, which radiates an ethereal light, are two seated angels, blanched by the strength of the light. One of the them gazes directly at the viewer. It seems likely that this work was painted between 1526 and 1528 during Holbeins first visit to England. It is painted on oak (which the artist did not use in Basel) and stylistically it conforms to Holbeins style at this date. An anonymous Noli Me Tangere appears in the inventories of Henry VIII, but Holbein did not work directly for the King until his second visit to England. It is likely that the painting was in the collection of Henrietta Maria, the widow of Charles I, who ended her days in the convent of Colombes near Paris, and that it was collected for Charles II after her death in 1669. The ointment jar held by Mary has been compared with contemporary French earthenware (from Saint Porchaire, for example) but it appears closer to the wares produced in Antwerp at the time and there is no reason to doubt that it is an object of Holbeins own design. Underdrawing, revealed by infra-red reflectography, and x-radiography show the care with which Holbein planned the work. He made several changes. One example is that in the x-ray one can see that Holbein orginally intended that Christ and Mary Magadalene should face each other squarely across the centre of the picture. He then heightened and enlarged the position of Christ to give him more dominance over the startled Magdalen. Another is that originally the Apostles were running towards a wicket gate, with a wooded landscape behind. In the final painting the trees were made into the city of Jerusalem towards which Peter and John rush with no impediment of a gate to an enclosed garden. The trees have been identified: on the left an elm, in the centre a hawthorn and on the right a larch. The meticulously painted myriad of plants at the feet of Christ and Mary have also been identified and both trees and plants have been interpreted as reinforcing the story because of their associations with for example healing, spiritualism, majesty, death, the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. This is the only religious painting by Holbein in the Royal Collection. In addition to the five miniatures and eighty drawings, there are seven painted portraits, all of them dating from Holbeins two stays in England"}, {"title": "Interior of the Church of Saint Katherine with Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican", "artist": "Daniel Hopfer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9avUm7xHClUj5WT1OIm9xWLP0pxZw0ObVJxrN-Z9V92edGFNNlwph7ajGAr-Q6ryv2tmSrMF4", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Simon", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-rwCNFNxpGvinVAYIXUXgQUUBlHrFzVBykDnYpgHzb2TOEySxWMXneexufwVw8ZeQVFwND0xgX", "desc": null}, {"title": "Confessor Saints", "artist": "Master of James IV of Scotland", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_DIhS35mRTT03HBeLEiNvErQU4qgsyKyOtOcVvIsaMm-9-8MtYDs0bdX_xKZjwdMyPrjjXWUVu", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christ Appearing to Mary Magdalene", "artist": "Martin Schongauer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Y44l628iRvQ43bkN3zsW_r4MQnVLfFk-TbYc2zDmh_7RQoXmCZl8RCXpNp05Z6-TVgguq88I", "desc": null}, {"title": "Cardinal Bandinello Sauli, His Secretary, and Two Geographers", "artist": "Sebastiano del Piombo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9r5fEqZZT8pdUPDbEwzrnuaXfp3wg7Im7G6_QdZeIFW2R3XikTqU7IfYKnJDQCLHuCJ94hTw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Nymph Supported by Two Satyrs", "artist": "Jean Honor\u00e9 Fragonard", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_vdRgmKSuj6sovLjTPkru7QqMOjSKLZxFiKjGbs-E082Ef0ojzh24TkbxAHfVP2ykLZQjz", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hercules Overcoming the Nemean Lion", "artist": "Albrecht Altdorfer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_FqkgUPpdzfxzdpss84Fdyiij-BRbibFTRBkyKU4pRapox4brG7kNhosUgDM9Lqy38J5DXaw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Eustace", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-iYDrSEk4egqSADXHGhG537L-8fTtZWytUQC5-kmJyrY8oayQsVbcKz7MJ2iAWa8PViILjx172", "desc": null}, {"title": "Dragonfly, Pear, Carnation, and Insect", "artist": "Joris Hoefnagel", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8gpVK4HCJqbZyR2mR5sgvkpVBd3vHmnQN1V4WaYDGBIEQC5rMTRZQloC9e-AAmOAPBUIfIBUs", "desc": "By contrasting the geometric symmetry of the dragonfly laid out in the center of the page with the more curvilinear, asymmetrical shapes of the pear and carnation below, Joris Hoefnagel created a sense of balance in this illumination.

Podio and A. Arrigoni in 1967 and 1968), the painting was attributed by her to D\u00fcrer. The attribution to Scipione Pulzone from Gaeta was put forward by Federico Zeri in connection with the investigations carried out in 1976, when ownership of the collection was transferred to the Cariplo. Zeri\u2019s opinion proves particularly significant in view of the fact that the Roman art historian was one of the greatest experts on Pulzone and wrote an acute study on him in the late 1950s. One of the leading figures in late Mannerism, Gaetano drew stylistically upon the great masters of the 16th century and his own colleagues active in Rome in the second half of the century, from Santi di Tito to the Zuccari brothers, as well as Jacopino da Conte, his master. In particular, as Alessandro Rovetta points out, Pulzone\u2019s model for the dramatically bowed figure seems to be the prototype of Correggio\u2019s Mary Magdalene in the Deposition (1527, Galleria Nazionale, Parma). This was widely known through an engraving by Adrien Collaert with a caption describing the episode precisely as Mary Magdalene weeping beside the tomb on realising that it was empty and assuming that the body of Christ had been stolen. The Cariplo canvas displays marked similarities with a version of the same subject painted by Pulzone for the Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano, Rome. The careful and highly sophisticated depiction of the clothing with the extraordinary minute rendering of the silver brocade and gilded embroidery of plant motifs, the highlights of the hair, the descriptive detail of the jar of ointment, which seems to be a copy a fine specimen of the goldsmith\u2019s art of the time painted from life, and the splendid landscape all make the canvas an important stage in the early work of an artist still influenced by the Florentine Mannerist focus on the elaborate rendering of every detail. For this reason, the Mary Magdalene at the Tomb should be regarded as coeval with the painting of 1574 in San Giovanni. It may even have been painted some time earlier, as the figure of the saint proves far more restrained in the work of 1574, possibly heralding the stylistic and spiritual evolution whereby Pulzone, as noted by Federico Zeri, came to adopt a very distant, austere and unadorned vocabulary fully in line with the Counter Reformation school of which he was one of the leading representatives. The Cariplo Magdalene instead displays the great virtuoso skills that the artist employed in his many portraits of the Roman nobility. As Rovetta points out, there is another version of the Magdalene in a private collection in the Emilia region attributed to the Flemish artist Denis Calvaert. Though incorrect, this attribution is indicative of Pulzone\u2019s links with Flemish painting, which emerges above all in the portraits and confirms his ability to draw upon different sources in an openly Mannerist spirit"}, {"title": "Portret van een jonge vrouw", "artist": "Moroni, Giambattista", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8w-TVwr_ljIo54Tj06ALJxnU0gX9-tgdtZ5OweaXEqbnBlCmPYkzxfgracHEL4XSZSYSwJSmE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Artist Drawing a Portrait of a Man", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_TQVBRSa-K7sk0Dje8KbrZfZsn6maYm_83cNs7ErzpQKP00au56IHFSX2zKaYc1uwS7wOJn3g", "desc": null}, {"title": "De heksentoer", "artist": "Veneziano, Agostino", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-bL3NypnYeCOxJ08ow_spresP9QYkhLB0Y7c9UVWZ2O7_GFGQkqYJCvPu6ars5RGOdv49f4Jc", "desc": null}, {"title": "Nymph and Shepherd", "artist": "Tiziano Vecellio", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9KOALXWN9z85uEs2Dd_wqbmmnAoa-bD15rfRcW4ocJvRf6Gpvrw96OXNfNZJ0rCDh4dAoH", "desc": "Blurred outlines that take shape only when viewed from a certain distance,particularly with regards to the motifs in the background, and a colour range fogged by a veil of grey are characteristic of Titian\u2019s late period.

Although the goddess does not set the theme, she adds another aspect of love to the Arcadian scene. Here painting demonstrates its potential to rival poetry.

All the paintings in which she appears, including the famous Venus of Urbino (1538, Florence, Uffizi Galleries), were created for Francesco Maria della Rovere, the nephew of Pope Julius II and Duke of Urbino from 1508, or for his son Guidobaldi. The present work is probably from that same period. The charming, erotically charged appearance of the unknown woman is not to be understood as a portrait: here Titian is celebrating a general concept of beauty, which was enhanced by contemporary lyric poetry under the influence of Petrarch. Along with the revealing posture of the beautiful woman, the main motif is the stimulating combination of fur and skin, an artistic strategy used before Titian by Giorgione in his Laura. The precious fur cloak has slid down the girl\u2019s right shoulder, exposing her breast. She is still holding the cloak to her body with her right hand, but she has made a first beginning. The ambivalence of her posture is based on a classical model: the type of the Venus Pudica resonates in Titian\u2019s painting. The precious jewellery \u2013 strings of pearls, ear-rings, bracelet and ring \u2013 creates distance and also opens another level of meaning in the picture as a portrait of a Venetian courtesan. In 1630 the painting found a famous admirer: Rubens copied Titian\u2019s work, which was then in English ownership, and later further developed the older artist\u2019s innovation in his own style. From Titian\u2019s comparatively reserved Renaissance portrait, Rubens developed an equally complex Baroque alternative in a full-length portrait of his second wife, Helena Fourment."}, {"title": "Serpent Speaking to a Young Man", "artist": "Marcantonio Raimondi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_5O0V_kiKa5fGpW-N5ZJeyKm8bKcYtzU6NI2-Wu9tgYQoLSC5FjQLUCnVXrnbWAm0GTQ_ZEe4", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Holy Family with a Donatrix as Saint Catherine of Alexandria", "artist": "Lorenzo Lotto", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Jt6hl6kfJaZNazGtUoW-zsWYl1-h5A1m2sUv5JXumsSDAeITe6c7H2lHOLhaOg9Bz2ZW-DMI", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Vision of the Seven Candlesticks, from The Apocalypse, German Edition 1498", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9nyY4MOv3OTyq7-4usO-3I1sx-TxuQKPhy8CrPfsoiTHEHgRvotM0shpi5ukXNWq9J4NQZ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Martyrdom of Saint Lucy", "artist": "Bernat Martorell", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8cPzFAU8dP-rhsOcB_ydUmHLPxWgkMkm6UiJhEEu151eevCe9pX1MT0RrUV2cOPkZv-zxw77c", "desc": null}, {"title": "Madonna in the Clouds", "artist": "Federico Barocci", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_gn_brYawY_doKmsM8MFhSBsiwQsF3PthaBO7k2XYvqlhKOwZr12iMtkK2rjz2dBvBZDnF40k", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Meeting of Joachim and Anne outside the Golden Gate of Jerusalem", "artist": "Filippino Lippi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_sgHxERDChmAr3Eu0AYBSjsR43XV72d0xIVhxGXAXGKyTFTJRu_dG9tOI-FEaU0gBlhSRo7rfh", "desc": "Filippino Lippi first studied under his father, Filippo Lippi (1406-1469), and subsequently under Sandro Botticelli (1445-1510), whose influence is evident in the elegant figures and the linear style.

From the mid 1530s until the early 1540s he trained in Brescia under the painter Alessandro Bonvicino, known as Moretto, with whom he collaborated for a time in the later 1540s. He then settled in Bergamo where, during the 1550s, he established himself as the city\u2019s leading painter. Then, for unknown reasons, he decided to return to the small town of Albino. This remained his base from the early 1560s for the rest of his life. Although he undertook commissions for religious subjects, Moroni is chiefly remarkable for his portraits which stand apart from the mainstream of Renaissance portraiture for their stern objectivity and startling vitality. While many of his clients were from patrician families, he also took subjects from less elevated ranks of society, the most famous example being a portrait in the National Gallery, London, representing a tailor at work. The intensity of Moronis portraiture depends on a precision and simplicity which were a novelty in the mid 16th century. The Portrait of a man in Sydney, is one of a number of simple bust length portraits painted during the artist\u2019s later period in which attention is concentrated exclusively on the sitter\u2019s head and shoulders. Bust length portraits, with their reference to the sculpture of classical antiquity, were outmoded by the mid-16th century, but the format was revived by Moroni as a means focussing on the sitter\u2019s psychology. Thus, although we see only the head and shoulders there is a tension in the figure which suggests he is standing, perhaps with his hands clasped in front of him. His pose is not relaxed and the light that flickers over the features lends them a vibrancy which is not without a shade of introspective anxiety, and hence of humanity"}, {"title": "Saint Christopher", "artist": "Lucas Cranach the Elder", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-Oew7b1ODQZQLFkJqyvJiGOm3OTYdHAViVEej9dG_Fvdig6O-Wmv-rUsLyaXVpwO5uMT85", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Margaret standing, a dragon at the left, from the series 'Piccoli Santi' (Small Saints)", "artist": "Marcantonio Raimondi", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9nAvQjatdV3qE2MoiS5KAbVteNgwkc7-5ltyoJP_0MNNexsI5IrtFsKIuJYWEEjYv5efucYD0", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Adoration of the Magi", "artist": "Giovanni Battista Tiepolo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9PL0bsYd7IZCKF8dadMstYztXWpw9CuAmzqo64091wPvA399iHFlQ4G7Vyz15Hi3ll1-jsPQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Gezicht op het Forum Romanum vanuit het Capitool", "artist": "Cock, Hieronymus", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-X3EJ5H3x71gNf_SZIgzy8CpE4cgaS3Lh0xPVX-Wl0p35O_YVVvQ0-PlPXimtUYckh4zVkpAs", "desc": null}, {"title": "Astrology", "artist": "Girolamo Francesco Maria Mazzola", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Al_qd5Tg9F12WZX3Jd-9SHU3KdKh5ixmqOAxSh3zgydeBhQP1Jh2tc0iNNzeUBkT-UPeFOA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Adam and Eve", "artist": "Lucas Cranach the Younger", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-vh9C8GhQHQJwmkWbAtXbnABcyREJUbf-GT3mFx_AAN3w5p7xD4lXQvGH94IAb3aYp_mWALp0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christ Crowned with Thorns, from The Passion", "artist": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9FWnOukd8aGSjQC41WP0Mbb__049QYx1INIfn3ZZoH9mI8_VOkYu7zJLYhaZRr3tN0fyWd", "desc": null}, {"title": "Guide for Constructing the Letter R", "artist": "Joris Hoefnagel", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8K6SKfcGrfmDu0H7XhLLUWwD_KnRaDAaD8nEGbioNttxR627MnC0ytIrEnFMh0afFMpGNF", "desc": "In this example of a letter Rfrom Joris Hoefnagels constructed alphabet, the artist provides both a geometric template and a completed character on the square grids at the center of the page.

These factors suggest that a Veneto region painter created the painting. Finally, E. Fahy has verbally conveyed the idea, reiterated by L. Puppi, that Montagna painted the work.

Gainsborough\u2019s familiarity with the works of Jan Wijnants is especially apparent in motifs such as the pollarded trees, travelers resting by a rutted road, and carefully observed plants. The degree to which these early landscapes represent specific sites has been debated, but clearly they express Gainsborough\u2019s genuine delight in the peaceful bounty of the English countryside. This fresh and sensitive outlook influenced later generations of landscape painters, including John Constable, who wrote, \u201cI fancy I see a Gainsborough in every hedge and  hollow tree."}, {"title": "The Infant Christ Distributing Bread to the Pilgrims", "artist": "Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-wsn1GcVBsUk25LsOrIBn5Lg0VKrfec4jXRQ9EmneFdWq4NC10y1uqTMocG_8hFNKxzNFvAF0", "desc": "To this day there still hangs a copy of the Budapest Jesus distributing Bread in its original location, a former rest-home for elderly priests in Seville. Murillos masterpiece enjoys their admiration not merely for its captivating, gentle charm, but also because it would hardly be possible to express more perfectly the mission of the institution. The vision of Jesus distributing bread reminds us of the Christians duty to care for those who fall by the wayside, a duty that originates with Christ himself. Yet it affirms this with a self-evident naturalness free of any didactic overtones. The viewers thus experience the not as a chore, but as an inner spiritual compulsion which they willingly obey.It was precisely this intimate immediacy and warm empathy which was the secret of Murillos popularity, which in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries rivalled Raphaels. Perhaps today the Spanish geniuss sentimental mood seems too cloying, but it never errs into kitsch: the subject of its deep humanism is not some wistful ideal, but an ordinary man of flesh and blood. Though the mood is lofty, within the figures flickers the ghost of Caravaggios plebeian characters. One former critic characterized his art as \"noble naturalism\". The dignity of the characters derives primarily from sincere humility, and it is this virtue that characterizes the gesture of the donor of Jesus distributing Bread, Canon Justino de Neve, who had his portrait placed among the needy pleading for charity."}, {"title": "Vase (one of a pair)", "artist": "Fran\u00e7ois Boucher", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM85aRll7k70x2WfNegSFFsKl_DnjdvGkldqHP8a0QpqOkx-UUoTrUDDRgOCGCgqpauzhJ1VDQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Eighth View of the Colosseum", "artist": "Hieronymus Cock", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-QrjsPNve_MD_iyGS8PmL3i9X1leeOrR99VtoVpSxOXKcPFros8Ye5ab-ev-M_uc8_AQTlpx8", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Prince of Saxony", "artist": "Lucas Cranach the Elder", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_FjR8UjbUcxdCid7Z-TPaUjp5Q42MBqBsUj_4P2c7ToBkcnXEVai_opOOUb0hKeCQiPu97Tg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Harbour Scene at Sunset, 1639", "artist": "Claude Gell\u00e9e", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-nCBBSOYssmBR6Ua_jg1s9X7C8pFdaTVOsIyF6CBg-JW4pbwCDB0eeHrHeuKU9eIFbZgRuBxU", "desc": "Claude Gell\u00e9e (1602-1682) is famous for his landscape paintings.
