Clouds have come up and the round shape of the full moon is half hidden behind the banks of cloud at the horizon. This means that the moonlight does not fall evenly but seems to be breaking out of a gateway in the clouds, creating a magical play of light. Complementary colours, ranging from golden to whitish yellow, violet and blue, define the contrasts of light and shade. There is a sense of the magnitude and unity of the universe. Moved by this wonder of nature, three people sit on rounded rocks near the shore, and their dark silhouettes heighten the effect of the gleaming light of the sky and the sea.

"desc": "The Museum of Fine Arts Budapest boasts several masterpieces by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, the leading figure of French Romantic painting. These paintings, drawings and lithographs are representative of all areas of the oeuvre of the artist, who rejected the Classicist cult of the line, and based his own style on the expressive power of colour.Delacroix was celebrated by his contemporaries almost exclusively as a painter, as he was reluctant to part with his drawings, which were not meant either for public display or for collectors. He kept his sketches and studies in his studio, which thus became publicly known only after his death. One of the rare exceptions is one of his most dramatic works, Horse Frightened by Lightning, which soon after completion he gave as a present to a friend, portrait and landscape painter Louis-Auguste Schwiter, in gratitude for the casts of a collection of antique medals, from which Delacroix made lithographs.The horse played a special role in the art of Delacroix in the 1820s. This was so because while preparing the monumental oil painting, Massacre at Chios (1824), he realised he needed a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the horse if he was to paint historical scenes. Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricaults romantically impassioned horse representations were of decisive influence for him, but he did not fail to incorporate in his art the experiences of his 1825 trip to London either. He devoted much time to studying the rearing horses of the Parthenon Marbles in the British Museum, of which he later made lithographs, and he must have been influenced by the work of popular painters of animals. The most immediate precedent of the white rearing horse with the flying mane in the watercolour held in Budapest is to be found in Sawrey Gilpins Horses in a Thunderstorm (1797-1798). Delacroix had to know this work, made for the Royal Academy, because he replicated almost exactly the horse which recoils from the lightning in the middle of the British painting. He transformed this unimportant detail into the main motif, and by meticulously working out the reaction of the animal, he created an emotional charge that makes the piece essentially different from the model. In this watercolour, Delacroix achieves the perfect synthesis of the emotive power of a landscape and that of an animal representation. The plane stretching into the distance and the stormy sky that seems to be its extension provide a background for the frightened, rearing horse, as if for a sculpture. The lighting that crosses the almost unrealistically deep blue sky throws a sharp light on the alarmed animal. The red of its eye and distended nostrils intensifies the panic into a vision. The vehemence of its motion and the gust of the storm ruffle its mane, while its tail is raised in the opposite direction. Delacroixs watercolour embodies all that the horse stood for in the eyes of the Romantics: power, nobility, untamed passion and intensified emotions. Though Alfred Robaut, the first monographer of the artist, dated the piece to 1824, thematic and stylistic links to other dramatic representations make modern scholars believe it was painted later, sometime between 1825 and 1829.Text:"}, {"title": "Boat-Building near Flatford Mill", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8jMqtrzgCIY8NqLkVO4kMzAx5otjlRr0qHbG1-4VhiktPieetKF9HuwHVk4HLzOf7LxGLQXw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Lady Maria Conyngham (died 1843)", "artist": "Sir Thomas Lawrence", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9_0tUrh0R8wk4CneF9SeJmYGsJc9klfJFEJH-6TBGqMzf4U6ltRud-_hkG02PwvLUDw_x4Vw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Meleager and Atalanta", "artist": "Oil on canvas", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM--fl_NiSluIlFtFn6QNkOfh7Dx4N8Ju2DCcRecRhnh4eVJrH27UFO_qouV5sYq9JajFVhdcciB", "desc": "Richard Wilsons subject is taken from the Latin poet Ovids Metamorphoses.

When first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839 with its pendant, Ancient Rome; Agrippina Landing with the Ashes of Germanicus, the painting was accompanied by a modified quotation from Lord Byrons masterpiece, Childe Harolds Pilgrimage (1818): \"The moon is up, and yet it is not night, / The sun as yet divides the day with her.\" Like the poem, Turners painting evokes the enduring sublimity of Rome, which had been for artists throughout history less a place in the real world than one in the imagination.

Held at Palazzo Tursi in Genoa, this sculpture is considered to be an exemplary icon of the Romantic poets. As opposed to the original and the marble version by Canova, the 1833 work sees the painter abandon his usual compositional structure and style, characterized by an elevated sensuality and realism, in order to achieve a more formal and expressive rigor that is academic in nature. The famous portrait artist and painter of scenes from 19th-century Milan outlines a minimalist landscape in the background: the cold, cerulean-clad silhouette of the solitary Mary Magdalene is painted against this backdrop, her hand gently gripping the cross.

Brought close to the viewer as if through a telescope, the summit of the Watzmann seems in its shining, almost glass-like clarity to be in immediate reach, apparently near enough to touch and at the same time distant, like a symbol of divine majesty. In compositional terms the bright mountain grows out of a single, highly variegated motion. Its pyramidal form culminates in the radiant whiteness of ice, a visual concept that Friedrich had already evolved a year previously in his famous painting Sea of Ice: The Wreck of Hope (Hamburger Kunsthalle). Friedrich put The Watzmann on show in 1825 at the Dresden Art Exhibition, probably in reaction to a major work under the same name by Ludwig Richter that was displayed there the year before, based on Josef Anton Koch\u2019s famous Schmadribach Waterfall (Neue Pinakothek, Munich). Friedrich rejected Richter\u2019s narrative approach: landscape painting had been \u201ccloser to its aims than it is at present \u2026 when piled-up objects, one next to the other, one behind the other and one above the other, overburden the picture, and I think are meant to lend opulence,\u201d was one of his statements on art. Friedrich, who never travelled to the Alps, painted The Watzmann on the basis of a watercolor study by his pupil August Heinrich and his own sketches made on journeys through the Harz and Riesengebirge mountains. The motif of the rock formations in the foreground follows a drawing of the Trudenstein at the Hohnekopf near the Brocken mountain done on 28 June 1811. In 1820 Friedrich had already depicted the anvil-like rock on the right in his landscape of the Riesengebirge Landscape with Rising Fog (Neue Pinakothek, Munich). In 1824, a year before The Watzmann, Friedrich showed a view of Montblanc (formerly in the Nationalgalerie, lost in the war) with an almost identical format at the Dresden Academy Exhibition.

They regarded it as a style of nature and the expression of growth striving for freedom. Friedrich\u2019s view of the ruins of Eldena, painted in 1824/25, was preceded by several drawings, including a nature study of 1803 (in the Hamburger Kunsthalle) that the painting largely follows.

Moreover, the arrangement of the fir trees brings to mind Romanticism\u2019s comparison of Gothic architecture and vegetable shapes.

The Water-carrier bears the imprint of both Goyas. At first glance it seems a simple rustic genre picture: a somewhat rough-hewn, yet ethereally charming young girl carries water and food to someone. A forerunner to this figure can be found on tapestry designs twenty years earlier, which Goya made for the Madrid court, at a moment of European optimism, when it seemed that the Enlightenment would bring general welfare. But then all hell was breaking loose and by the time the picture was made Spain had been sacked by Napoleons troops. The idyllic world of the tapestries had gone, and the air is charged with a surly restlessness instead. Indeed, it is war we see here: the water is needed by the nameless heroes of Zaragoza, who held up the invaders practically with their bare hands.

Delacroix had first captured this subject--Chiron, the wisest of all centaurs, training Achilles in the art of hunting--on a corner of a curved ceiling devoted to poetry in Pariss Palais Bourbon Library, which he decorated from 1838 to 1847. On visits to Delacroixs studio twenty years later, Sand admired the new, rectangular painting of the subject the artist was working on. That canvas was promised to another admirer, so Delacroix made this nearly identical pastel for her and wrote to Sands son, Maurice, informing him of the gift.  Highly educated in the classics, Delacroix depicted subjects from antiquity throughout his life.

The name comes from Phaeton, the son of Apollo, who borrowed and crashed his fathers sun-chariot. For a smooth ride, even at speed, the Phaeton had large wheels and huge steel leaf-springs, from which the seat was suspended by means of leather straps, which gave it the nick-name High-Flyer and occasioned numerous satires. In some examples the two axels were the only rigid elements of the design, connected by another steel leaf-spring to allow the vehicle to flex over bumps, like modern independent suspension. Contemporary illustrations suggest that that this fine example of British industrial design was regarded as the pinnacle of fashion and symbol of fast living, women drivers being especially singled out for admiration or opprobrium. When the Prince of Wales over-turned his Phaeton, while driving alone with Mrs Fitzherbert, he presented satirists with an easy target. The Princes carriage here is to be drawn by two magnificently sleek black horses, whose coats and accoutrements match the colours of the carriage and the livery of the groom. The artist explains the harnesses and provides a three-quarter view of the carriage without drawing attention to the technical difficulty of either. This is a scene designed to appeal to the discerning eye of a man of fashion, who in this era would have possessed some expertise in horse-flesh and a more general concern that their mews should be efficiently run and their servants well turned-out. Such things mattered because they reflected on the owner and master. Contemporaries would have recognised in this painting a reflection upon (even a portrait of) the owner of this equipage - the Prince of Wales. We see here a Prince unstuffy enough to drive his own carriage, reducing the trappings of rank to a set of modest silver arms decorating the horses blinkers. The pomp of a Prince is replaced by the elegance of a man of fashion. The quiet dignity of this scene, supported by the Princes portly coachman and methodical assistant, is only disrupted by his Spitz dog, Fino, leaping up at the horse, which starts back in alarm.

At the centre is the Campanile and Basilica of San Marco, the red bricks of the tower emphasizing the unnaturally whitened, almost ghostly domes. To its right is the distinctive upper level of the Doges Palace, which appears somewhat compressed in Turners rendering of it. The building with the attenuated cupola to the right is the Zecca, or Mint. Just above this, two vertical strokes of Turners brush indicate the famous columns of the Lion of San Marco and San Theodore, standing in the Piazzetta. From there the paved Riva degli Schiavoni stretches into the distance, fringed by countless boats. Off to the right, fireworks explode above the larger vessels moored in the harbour alongside Palladios church of San Giorgio Maggiore. In the square, a mass of revellers are dressed for carnival, their attention divided between musicians, puppet shows and the burst of fireworks alongside Florians caf\u00e9. This work is a nocturnal scene where fire erupts into the darkness, captivating the onlookers. Some scholars have speculated that Turner exploited these effects to play on the well-established comparison between the formerly great Venice, then subject to Austrian law, and contemporary London. The title of the picture, however, invoked Shakespeares play Romeo and Juliet, the festive Piazza presumably standing in for the Capulets ball. The young John Ruskin (1819-1900), later an influential writer on art and society, was among those who have taken up the challenge of defending Turners iconography and his alleged topographical infelicities in the depiction of Venice. But, ultimately, the picture needs no apologist, for it is one of the most appealingly atmospheric canvases of the second half of Turners career: its powerful combination of dynamic perspective and punctuating bursts of light is readily apparent"}, {"title": "Flatford Lock", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Hgb8sFdNVdZuYH7USIkRanqav0XaxzQeVmHOgHXOYBuzdrjhhwWw0ljI7_S1lUv7jviMGtg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ira Aldridge in the Role of Shakespeare's Othello", "artist": "William Mulready", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8wj10VOcswRu-k3XCDw_bJn-wagCiCPTr2KPHDw-mh1MHULl4RYTcVjaP3D8Cs018DjzOf", "desc": "The subject of this work shows a marked resemblance to the famous African-American actor Ira Aldridge (1807-1867), praised as one of the greatest tragic actors of his day, he won renown in Europe for his Shakespearean roles, including Lear, Macbeth and, most famously, Othello. On October 10, 1825, Aldridge made his European debut, making him the first African American actor to establish himself professionally in a foreign country (at Londons Royal Coburg Theatre). The following year he played Othello. By the time of his death in 1867 he had won awards and medals all over Europe, having played in Berlin, Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Cologne, Bonn, Budapest and the major cities of Russia. An innovation Aldridge introduced early in his career was a direct address to the audience on the closing night of his engagement at a given theatre.

Written in the early fourteenth century, this epic poem recounts Dante\u2019s imaginary pilgrimage through Hell and Purgatory to Paradise. Commissioned by his last patron, John Linnell, Blake produced 102 drawings illustrating the Divine Comedy between 1824 and his death in 1827. These drawings range from preliminary sketches to highly finished watercolours. Only seven of the compositions were engraved for Linnell\u2019s proposed publication. Blake\u2019s personal theology led him not only to illustrate but to comment upon, and even criticize, Dante\u2019s Catholic interpretation of salvation, stating that \u2018Dante saw Devils where I see none \u2013 I see only good\u2019. In Paradise Dante, guided by his beloved Beatrice, meets St Peter and St James who are illuminated by the brilliant flames of redemption. The ethereal world is radiantly evoked by the translucent rainbow hues, while the figures are clearly influenced by the art of Michelangelo, just as others in the series pay tribute to D\u00fcrer"}, {"title": "A Horse Affrighted at a Lion", "artist": "George Stubbs", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-oO6o1qHZ4WsTT7Rlr2RBR1hF6An3qHth51ErTL0Tsm1bsr9eRu5sB-HuvSuxK59sPQDq1Bcg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Forest Interior by Moonlight", "artist": "Caspar David Friedrich", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Y1Xrkm6WTLpfC__sP0zLVZna3vT686CGsF-K7ODFkYFrEwp210_ksgOicwmnqcdAcEmzdC48", "desc": "Whereas Italy was regarded as the land for which all artists yearned in the 18th and 19th centuries, Caspar David Friedrich felt drawn to the landscapes of northern Europe. He made several journeys to the Baltic Sea, to the mountains of Saxony and Bohemia; many of his coast, mountain and forest landscapes testify to this. The wonderfully radiant blue of the night sky is the dominant tone in this painting. A white full moon behind a tracery of pines lights up the cleared slopes of a forest ravine. The moonlight that illuminates the forest does not, however, seem to reach the shadowy foreground. Here, between mounds of earth and the stumps of trees, a man and a woman have taken refuge in a cave and lit a warming fire, over which they are preparing a meal. The mood of mystery of the nocturnal forest landscape suggests a religious interpretation. According to this, the hills in the foreground and the fire in the cave refer to the pains and transitory nature of earthly existence. The finely articulated pine forest behind them, by contrast, possesses an almost immaterial quality; by comparison with the scene in the foreground it appears to be a realm beyond and remote from the world and comes to a climax in the blue night sky. Friedrich juxtaposes the labours of life on the earth with the beauty and solace of a moonlit night. This work, once owned by the Berlin publisher Georg Andreas Reimer, was unknown to researchers until 1992, when it reappeared on the art market and was acquired for the Nationalgalerie"}, {"title": "Job's Evil Dreams", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_A7a8K4L0wkRge7bDpwpT8VXgH70DROAumjQb7gK2TW8x29B0yzM0l7_R3f01wI9Z8wFjbnQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Fall of the Accuser", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_E_UE_HT-d_zOXyrg85IvWIO3WzqvsfJFtnX1t63xqI6cw8dpw1bSQ3ivXe3dlpIbDSrNriLk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Three men digging; folio 51 from the Images of Spain Album 'F'", "artist": "Francisco de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-H-dlHEngCDAnbgB3o9ejTrOaoc7Yo4_N5WrIhfLRGY0hYxLlFDJwnHXLegbnhptvkAOCVoDI", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Seven Ages of Man: The Lover, 'As You Like It,' II, vii", "artist": "chairs", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9je3XGh63gtTLWcCe1xKMnpjJKdbflBtsS4x-SYsrEWf-z_z3OwdZATnvbwihaYP3ZQD9XWaCf", "desc": null}, {"title": "La casa de locos", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_yssr9YNl_5UENkkeGXmftYCL6Gm4qAPV0-9eHwDMW4ON8XteQIRgKIs0cqcfaIqfW8qkzsWQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "It's Raining Elves (\"Llueven duendes\")", "artist": "Leonardo Alenza y Nieto", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8BJUzNxEgVn5FmboKD_FijCvysVXgntldnPeelOC6JIgz8BhOCfTzcAK-n8hVc_iQ7i-9-M2c", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Woman with Gambling Mania, 1820", "artist": "Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_sECi93SsGB1I0IQNF0mAWjAH2LAloRRkITZ-q7IOZn8yH3Nc81bh9j405yndFBRkHV7ZxebY", "desc": null}, {"title": "Disparate pobre", "artist": "Francisco Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-lu-Zg9GZGXcCYDUBIFoP5g6BzmyDIfQqNSG78UbpVhRTF-QXosYBZQJGdHiuuUSMAwj6bTFo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Thou who cannot", "artist": "Francisco Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9cAbgSxhMki-OVczt4dIB7aVnWUZf9N0QhgvGda_d3kNZl3nUHCznMUlNVd2MPdWFxuzdmjQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Caernarvon Castle", "artist": "Joseph Farington", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-PfOJCqIXy1sr6NitH4WDHtwrc3gv71fc43n166u5WbiDcwwkVzA21sZ5g5VoiOiLI55Kh2QmZ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Behemoth and Leviathan", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_kDZWbLjnA86trg4LGWgX7oOJYsKwWVFQEiJyBjAI9NhMwjVYcmlKZ5JXyHXpvYypUNrPKXuM", "desc": null}, {"title": "Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM90cppcYd8NSx44CJdjEY7L_1KNbhVEdNJfxrB4SEuMdfA1uCE9kTKXnfitGMGPfwY5jrREEw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Satan Smiting Job with Boils, from Illustrations of the Book of Job", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_SPHL8cfaKQ_sp3OBl6eofI3uXkAsjh3IP1evAr9oVpqa9IkhVS0rcl9Y0c9HCmvb3aMw9WRM", "desc": null}, {"title": "Pauline Runge with her two-year-old-son", "artist": "Philipp Otto Runge", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_4_g9pNMhfY3lGQ01uUXZ-U8448e0LXjqbe4rmH0bWY0qIGNZhS_1zwWl0nLeNkH6_vvMQFgk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Abbey St-Amand, Rouen", "artist": "Richard Parkes Bonington", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_FehbzuHAv7wWM1nYH-yHxl063EfAx1EUeJFZlGycZEGE6bTIPRUQhiQZQbAagM_xyO3xrgHE", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Meeting of Orestes and Hermione", "artist": "Anne-Louis Girodet de Roucy", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-I3b-75xaFT_K6lDGQK0DqhyxyxlxifN7knIFTB3s-g1xkFo-hYEfwHSvDfoEmfu9hBqhWhYk", "desc": "When the French painter Jacques-Louis David was approached to work on a new edition of Jean Racine\u2019s plays, he passed the task to his pupil Girodet, who excelled at illustrating literature.

The canvas, which was the property of Litta Modignani in 1934, reappeared on the antique market in the 1990s when it was purchased by Cariplo. The episode of Peter the Hermit preaching in the square of Clermont, in the presence of Urban II is inspired by Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Michaud\u2019s Histoire des croisades, translated into Italian in 1826. After the Council held in Clermont in November 1095, the pope launched his famous appeal inviting Christian knights to intervene in defence of the Church, and to aid their Eastern brothers in the Holy Land. In his faithful pictorial transposition of the literary text Hayez arranges the scene around the tall throne erected for the pope in the square packed with a huge crowd, and focuses on the main events: Peter the Hermit\u2019s preaching and the distribution of red cloth crosses destined to be worn by those who engaged to do battle. This canvas once again displays the artist\u2019s indisputable skill in rendering the garments and setting within the precise reconstruction of an episode drawn from medieval history, and above all it reveals the potential of history painting to express the feelings and reactions of a crowd. Powerful dramatic and emotional moments alternate with moving elegiac scenes of farewell, like that of the couple kissing in the foreground or the woman left alone with her baby, an obvious allusion to the father\u2019s departure. When it appeared in 1835 it had a mixed reception from the critics: some said the composition was disorganized in its orchestration of the numerous different groups and the handling was too hasty especially as regards the crowd in the distance, but most praised the freshness of the execution and the rich variety of expression. Hayez also painted other works on the theme of the Crusades, full of political allusions to the contemporary Italian situation and the need for national liberation: the famous Peter the Hermit, 1829 (private collection), a real appeal to the cause of independence, and Thirst for the Crusades (Turin, Palazzo Reale)"}, {"title": "Hamlet and Guildenstern (Act III, Scene II)", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9p9bxfiPs3XipJrXyqJIpmRlIlfgEw6tt9yF7EZwfYmy9GSpf0xKMKq990RWwd63Ok6Puidw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Fifth Plague of Egypt", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-P2l04xNCE6vB2ecVWbMhkdpBUUOVujrxCRwvjvuVaHtgRR2rm7bdD-EQRUVCzZDjbbNAVkhLI", "desc": null}, {"title": "African Beach", "artist": "Drawing", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8m3ZHaFSZHGvftKQ7teq9QAbpCOMTmHlG4x5Q8SeIRRC-DBK38Dy2TwV3c-7WmEkLTO-7-kQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ulysses at the Court of Alcinous", "artist": "Francesco Hayez", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8fO2e2qprf0TMeZSHShkd2vYpRnWGNFU6ukCa6V0tgIln783Qeb6Fg7aeRsAEJmd5dX8tlRM0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Allegory of Love, Cupid and Psyche [?]", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_OIrYlFLjsd2cMT1oKz4Rasvy_maLjXug8UNGdISX-ewBZCp6651lMqMr3e2TY3_vM-RWM", "desc": "The scene is associated with the story of Cupid and Psyche, immortalised in the Metamorphoses by Lucius Apuleius, in which the god of sexual attraction falls in love with Psyche and visits her at night always to conceal his identity.

The artist represents the moment when, on September 5 and 6, 1838, the Temeraire was towed, from the Thames estuary (from Sheerness) to its place of demolition (at Rotherhithe), by a steam tug. The dark and heavy form of the latter is brought to life as an innovative driving force, as evidenced by the tall smoking chimney and the two paddle wheels. It contrasts with the noble whitish silhouette of the Temeraire, which seems to glide, like a phantom vessel on the waves, towards its ultimate end. Turner accentuates the dramatic destiny of the warship by placing the scene at the end of the day, in the setting sun. The moon is also present, at the top left; its light is reflected in the calm waters. The sky inflamed with yellow, orange, red and mauve floods the surface of the painting, creating a vaporous and dramatic atmosphere, attenuated by the blue of the horizon.The painter took liberties in describing the event and the boats. At the time of the events, the Temeraire was disarmed and without rigging, but Turner added these; it was pulled by two tugs, Turner shows only one and he reverses the position of his chimney and his mast on which flies a white flag. Turner did not want to represent the reality of the scene which he may not have seen. He wanted to convey an emotion and transform the event into a metaphor. It symbolizes a turning point in the history of navigation and its development towards modernity: the end of the majestic sailing ships and their gradual replacement by steamships , the future of the navy"}, {"title": "A Stalk of Lilies with Six Blooms", "artist": "Philipp Otto Runge", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8GCiOO4a12k9hFEAzg288G8sKQuS7HMreQo18mhA4So29H-YDc0rhQdIwOm_lPJk_BPrXzHQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landscape with Gypsies and Wagon", "artist": "David Cox", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9XVdPADJOZpgWjKljYMCiU1-72HurQlei50j5SsmTyEqzC1HV-VHVbh7UxOlt9UiXU8Xf1M1o", "desc": null}, {"title": "Fantasia Arabe", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne\u00a0Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_LyQzZP79bmUwwh7S3pDoT13PWyKpNjDiMGypNs92UVM8-CnTOqgQSey04WjijVbCRR196dJQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Still Life with Flowers, Shells, a Shark's Head, and Petrifications", "artist": " Philadelphia Museum of Art", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-KDSmsniEkbMyzlxmoKXIqP6WhtFeVfa_QLWvGg9Z3ZtgAfQ8gnFGRyujrIt3CN1FJ9V4i3kk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Fool`s Folly", "artist": "Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_C3pESiTX0yZ1oPMLwn2S1ecIh-GibFeo0bwznImd0J48Gimy0CqRmXyOGXD9wMbtZLZs64A", "desc": null}, {"title": "Brighton Beach", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8ZRfQUkPDw3NiieJcffxRlTybGHI670-cEXfoQj4eL0Tt3Dy-1SripzYs94FqMkdHbG_ba1uI", "desc": null}, {"title": "St. S\u00e9verin, Paris", "artist": "Thomas Shotter Boys", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Ih3XP5fyg3HXk6yoMNuJm8ALePesaUsEx9tzhTZf2Cx-yLQVO4RicbILPOHojyV5SDEibDw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Library in the Apartment of Count Lanckoronski in Vienna, Riemergasse 8", "artist": "Rudolf von  Alt", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8IMdgJWLACiS_7V-9ZgM8QLtQ-NbCMdLh0HoU1FYDgzC8InIcfNThkW6Yy1pM5PwF6hn6oo506", "desc": "The library of Count Lanckoronski reveals the scholarly interests of a wealthy nobleman.

Born to an artisan in provincial Baden in the early nineteenth century, he soon became widely renowned for his portraits of European royalty and aristocrats. He was known as the painter of princes and travelled tirelessly to courts in France, Belgium, Great Britain, Austria, Spain and Portugal in pursuit of commissions, which he and his younger brother Hermann then executed in their Paris studio. In 1870 the Winterhalter brothers returned to their native Baden, having run a flourishing business in the French capital since 1834. While Franz visited the clients and did portrait drawings of their subjects, Hermann ran the studio and was in charge of the apprentices. Although Hermann did produce paintings of his own, he was frequently occupied making copies of highly sought-after compositions by his brother. In the end Hermann became so adept at imitating Franzs style that to this day it is barely possible to definitively identify work as that of either one or the other"}, {"title": "Plate 46 from ' Los Caprichos': Correction (Correccion.)", "artist": "Francisco de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8BwsfciZl8GkhV1Cugh_6WRI9jE6QtPmu7iVKhVMYe4pE71MvgfOkJ3pca6kGX31w6o46x6joS", "desc": null}, {"title": "New Rome.

Fuseli selected his themes from literature, but his idiosyncratic interpretation can make it difficult to identify exact subjects. The curtain creates the stagelike effect, which, along with the linear, abstract representation of monumental figures, recall Fuselis Shakespearean drawings of the early 1770s, made during his years in Italy.

The Huesca Museum piece was painted in 1880 and is an example of history painting, which was very popular in the 19th century.

Above all, the depiction of the ruins of Gothic churches, with nature rapidly reclaiming them, visualized the tension between decay and the emergence of the new. Blechen intensifies the refined subdivisions of the masses and the light-suffused Gothic religious edifice in his watercolour: The fragments of the ribbed vaults and pointed arches are filled with brightness and the luminescent colours of the surrounding nature. Unlike C. D. Friedrich\u2019s landscapes with ruins dating from the same period, Blechen\u2019s pieces are not intended to leave us contemplatively pondering religion. Blechen\u2019s fictitious scenes are defined by a stage-setlike composition and staging.

This work reflects the artists sense of tragedy as he suffered from illness and the deaths of his friends. The works deep religiosity relates to the character of his revered Rembrandt. According to Ren\u00e9 Huyghe, the motif of steps moving from above ground to below ground appears in several works by Rembrandt, and the S-shaped form provides the work with appropriate compositional movement.\tBaudelaire made the following comment regarding this painting in his critique of the 1859 Salon, \"There is no finer expression of this theme than Christ Carried Down to the Tomb (originally referred to as The Entombment of Christ). It would take a Titian to create such a work. He would use a different method in the creation of his composition but, yes this is true.

Jahrhunderts, so formte sich auch im biedermeierlichen Wien die Blumenmalerei zu einer eigenst\u00e4ndigen Gattung aus, die in Europa einzigartig ist. Sie setzte eine Tradition fort, die der Maler Johann Baptist Drechsler Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts \u00fcber die Kunstschule der Wiener Porzellanmanufaktur begr\u00fcndet hatte.Von Jugend an, besonders aber seit den sp\u00e4ten zwanziger Jahren arbeitete auch Waldm\u00fcller auf diesem Gebiet, in das er schon als Kind eingef\u00fchrt worden war. So unterschiedliche Stoffgebiete er auch ber\u00fchrte, stets entstanden Werkgruppen, Varianten eines Typus, so in der Portr\u00e4t-, in der Landschafts-, in der Genre- und in der Stillebenmalerei. Weit davon entfernt, Gegenst\u00e4nde des Alltags durch die Malkunst adeln zu wollen (vgl. die Blumenstilleben von Thoma, Manet, C\u00e9zanne), w\u00e4hlte Waldm\u00fcller ausschlie\u00dflich Kostbarstes: empfindliche Blumenz\u00fcchtungen, Silber, Edelsteinschmuck und Antikes (der rotfigurige Glockenkrater mit dionysischer Darstellung ist im Kunsthistorischen Museum in Wien erhalten), das er auf buntem Marmor vor einem Gobelin (in dem man ein Rubens-Vorbild erkannt hat) arrangiert. Stilleben sind stets Abbreviaturen f\u00fcr eine Welt. Dieses ist nicht ein Konzentrat von \u203aNatur\u2039, \u203aParadies\u2039 oder \u203aHaus\u2039, sondern eindeutig von \u203aSalon\u2039. Eine aristokratische Lebenssph\u00e4re von h\u00f6chster Kostbarkeit und K\u00fcnstlichkeit gibt sich zu erkennen, und mit diesen bis ins letzte scharf ausformulierten Formen, mit diesen differenzierten Oberfl\u00e4chenbeschaffenheiten und Lichtstufungen bekennt sich die Malkunst zu einer verfeinerten Handwerklichkeit, die alle Virtuosit\u00e4t hinter sich gelassen hat.

The painting\u2019s three vanishing points make the forest interior look like the nave and two aisles of a basilica. Only a few individual rays of light penetrate the cathedral-like vault of dense foliage and scatter restlessly among the deep shadows of the forest.

She is shown au naturel, on foot and framed by the landscape, in a manner that greatly appealed to local tastes. There is no opposition between the sophisticated style of the portrait and the model\u2019s informal pose and captivating sense of freshness. On the contrary, the piece retains the spontaneity that characterises the painter\u2019s best work in the genre.Although the painting bears some similarities to other representations of women made by the artist in the same period, it stands out for its unrivalled refinement.

In 1817, he traveled to Rome where he witnessed the annual Carnival horse race and subsequently made numerous studies of this spectacle. This study marks the moment just before the race begins, when the terrified riderless horses begin their run down the Corso in Rome.A groom tries to contain a rearing horse in the center, while other men all around push and pull the wild animals, goading them into a frenzied stampede.

Reproduced in engravings and described in detail in the press, the work shows the same handling of light and perspective as the previous versions but differs in terms of the episodes depicted and its larger size. The illusionistic effect of placing the viewer in the main doorway of Milan Cathedral between the two rows of pillars in the nave is obtained by combining a solid perspective grid with a calibrated play of light, entering from the windows on the right and striking the pillars and the floor, while the darkness of the vaulted ceiling is pierced by a single shaft from the window in the upper storey. In the background, the high altar, where Mass is being celebrated, is festively adorned and illuminated by numerous candles creating a virtuoso light effect. Reports of the period praised the work for the great realism and variety of the social types portrayed, focusing in particular on the minor episode of a sumptuously dressed young woman in the group of  figures in the light in the nave. She is turning her head to the right in search of an elegant young man at the far end of the church, who returns her gaze. Migliara continued to feature this subject in numerous works until the 1830s, some of which were commissioned by members of the aristocracy and the upper middle classes, including the viceroy Archduke Ranieri, the Melzi d\u2019Eril family and Countess Giulia Samoyloff. From the miniature on silk to the large canvas, adopting the same perspective viewpoint with slight variations as regards the lighting and the episodes depicted, this ultimately became a classic view of the cathedral interior. The model was taken up by the \u201cMigliaristi\u201d Giovanni Battista dell\u2019Acqua and Pompeo Calvi, who were followed in the second half of the century by Filippo Carcano and Arturo Ferrrari"}, {"title": "Plate 5 from 'The Disasters of War' (Los Desastres de la Guerra): 'And they are like wild beasts.'

Its building began in August 1845, and the bridge was inaugurated in April 1847, but on 28 September 1852, as a result of a flood, it collapsed taking the people who were crossing with it. As a result, the painting became a splendid and unique testimony of this early piece of engineering"}, {"title": "A Churchyard with Ruined Tower Among Trees on Rising Ground", "artist": "Thomas Gainsborough", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM885_zgmo9ieXRUbr9-P-OTy1Q8qfzvasYCkeJe8ouGUHa5qeNNpXiKNtO-Wm-tDNkWAZJZ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Horrors of War:  It Always Happens", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_iSsDvJmPaEdbedgmYnafD4qHygef6WWxWnEpxBIrtV8o4uzv1s2pmOSTASB6g15q9e_FXc1w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Caprichos:  Nothing Could Be Done About It", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_ik3HUeWOjXjchfAnZz5sg5-kkCYY5wq1jfsUzRqoqczKxfNoPwVdppoAi19VLh-3MnyquFw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Derbyshire Landscape", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-FOdEBdG6tUTV4pM-0bL7xlcMidxrh5ZjdcyonlUbUyG5tFwUL50-GfVDJ26F-VWPIjUpM7w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Labourers", "artist": "George Stubbs", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8m5VJiDh_MxlY3FHoBrMQ7Wx5Fp-r7iTPXorYLjpUkqdnDkWZFir-AFyb1zu9Fn3_rRgvStA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Satan Before the Throne of God, from Illustrations of the Book of Job", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_smgS2NGLRCwXweWQmjCDCeMFonFcuoaIOalw2DX1MpqyP7EEHXHCT_quUpI0P4ZEQHdduEzI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Lion and Serpent (Lion au Serpent)", "artist": "Antoine-Louis Barye", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8EC99GTcTWeb1kkvJ5AWZR6wZamKJcE_LawTBvBxtYUzg7cxzXzCelF8hnCO407ONoEiMJ8w-j", "desc": null}, {"title": "Thenot Remonstrates With Colinet, from Thornton's Pastorals of Virgil", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-cgw4BBZOnb-giErtxxiHdIB7NR9SIgW8t88y99VwQqp8ZlZQwbI8YwcMVDG98s4Otc3JOhm0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Rue du gros-horloge, Rouen", "artist": "Richard Parkes Bonington", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8QUb5-dRmHPGNhC9C3Y2muRuFgmxKwHDToUlk2J0mBGbvKUsoxTL4XgRAqrpAlxOwTh0rh1g", "desc": null}, {"title": "View Along the Norman Coast", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Isabey", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9px-K2GJ75_KHcVk45PGjLAXIoyp3YEGAKzEN4IPz7l80cBKucLhsmerT_-NpOccKa4zQCpMs", "desc": null}, {"title": "Faust and Mephistopheles in the Hartz Mountains (Goethe, Faust)", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9X0Yf9dBWwsZwe6v6yGUYiRe3LTzjLLwyd9_h7VdnUl8OK0zWGliAyOPucmwQ88iQbClzR", "desc": null}, {"title": "What a tailor can do!", "artist": "Francisco Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9K__xCjSYP0VHMDBjMdLmHcHowlqujuJ4j_bSEfMpVNhOf3Tk9UWa_THz-Zjc4YPScbvqIah4", "desc": null}, {"title": "Fulham Church from across the River", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-SSidoWETE1NfwNyNFGja-VU-8kjklLOokw8zCEctSKE_gUZNq3KQMTSvO0GSeDSAE6fHcd2A", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Fish Market at Hastings Beach", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8wTnIvv20S_JI7v__XVCqcESM25D4mvPoT3sspGEvd3c-yQsdJr2TX-FJfgKZhvOPR34Xq-DPO", "desc": "J.

Long believed to have been lost, it was presented for the first time to the general public in 1983 at the anthological exhibition of work by Francesco Hayez at the Palazzo Reale in Milan. On that important occasion, which marked the start of critical reappraisal of the artist\u2019s work and key role in the romantic movement, it was identified as a section of the huge canvas The Death of Abradates, painted in the spring of 1813 during the artist\u2019s stay in Rome for the first-class competition of the Brera Academy. In his memoirs Hayez outlines the events connected with the painting\u2019s complex gestation, which involved two of the leading figures in the world of art at the time, both of whom played a crucial role in the moulding of the young artist, namely the sculptor Antonio Canova and Count Leopoldo Cicognara, then president of the Venice Academy of Fine Arts. It was in fact Cicognara that urged Hayez to take part in the annual competition of the Brera Academy early in 1813 through a letter addressed to their mutual friend Antonio Canova. This was prompted by the unsatisfactory results obtained by the painter the previous year, when his huge canvas Laocoon (Milan, Accademia di Brera) was awarded the joint first prize together with a work by Antonio De Antoni, the pupil of Andrea Appiani, premier peintre to the Emperor Napoleon and an authoritative member of the Milanese Academy. The decision was dictated by considerations of internal politics and deeply offended both the young artist, who was well aware of the marked superiority of his work, and above all his Venetian protector, who urged him to compete again in 1813, confident of an overwhelming victory this time. After a initial attempt to avoid this challenge and above all the risk of fresh disappointment, the painter yielded to Cicognara\u2019s persuasion and addressed the set subject in a canvas of monumental proportions. Having completed the heads of the main group, however, he staged an accident so that a large easel fell on the painting and damaged it irreparably. The set subject of the competition that year, namely the death of Abradates, is taken from a passage in the Cyropaedia of Xenophon (VI, 3 and VII, 3) that relates the grief shown by Cyrus, the all-powerful king of the Persians, on the death of Abradates, initially his enemy and later his ally in the war against Croesus. It thus lent itself to glorification of the moral qualities of the Persian monarch and hence by association those of Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of the French. For this exemplary work of history painting, still bound by the dictates of the neoclassical school, Hayez combined the ancient text with elements drawn from his reading of the popular contemporary novel Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Gr\u00e8ce by the Jesuit Jean Jacques Barthelemy (1793). The surviving section of the work shows the group of figures led by Cyrus, who indicates the funeral gifts with a wave of his hand while gazing upon the now lost main group of Queen Panthea embracing the corpse of her husband Abradates. The figure in the truncated conical hat looking in the opposite direction to the main event can be identified as the painter Tommaso Minardi, recalled by Hayez in his memoirs as ironic and insincere. This intense and realistic portrait of the future founder of the Purist movement provides significant evidence of the two artists\u2019 relationship and period of training together in Rome before they went their separate ways"}, {"title": "Moonlight", "artist": " http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/697/Moonlight", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_-ndffW3Wp5EJm1gCGeTks6_WsAjKJUL2blR3p4D1wsUHbchLUmmxOP6HyCiwX3kP_UfdAnYk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Die soldaat!", "artist": "Goya, Francisco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-A6zUByqR-Mge5wePoilaZvd4Mc4zmzBpBSBpY9EquxBcEKdJqn1e6nWtzfaOr-VMRKq_EKkU", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Picador Caught by a Bull", "artist": "Francisco de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9wKEBOwRvCyzgO660Tb-h29Z1ykxzEuEaaEacGs105F-yQ1Fs9kmiMBAGa113UvIx1YrQYt7NI", "desc": "This 1825 print by Francisco de Goya is part of The Bulls of Bordeaux, a series of four lithographs: Spanish Entertainment; The Famous American, Mariano Ceballos; A Picador Caught by a Bull; and Bullfight in a Divided Ring.

On loan from the Ch\u00e2teau de Flers museum in 2000 for a retrospective on the painter, the artwork was then, most spectacularly, reattributed to Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791\u20131824). Bruno Chenique and Sylvain Laveissi\u00e8re, who researched the comparison, found a series of convincing matches with confirmed paintings by the great master. According to their analysis, the artwork has the characteristics of a G\u00e9ricault in terms of framing and the rendering of skin and clothes. To support his hypothesis, Bruno Chenique made painstaking comparisons with the mane of the Head of a White Horse by G\u00e9ricault, with the eyes of the Portrait of a Kleptomaniac and with the skin of the Severed Heads, strange still-life studies the artist used as documentary material for The Raft of the Medusa. Nevertheless, not all experts agree on the attribution to G\u00e9ricault, which remains the subject of passionate debate. The painting still holds secrets, and some points, such as its dating and its aim, remain to be clarified.The subject of the painting suggests that the artwork was completed in Rome, where Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault resided in 1816 and 1817. The model, an elderly woman, her skin leathered from the sun, is portrayed in several paintings by artists who stayed at the Villa Medici in the 1820s. L\u00e9on Cogniet shows her in a pose similar to that of G\u00e9ricault, Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Navez places her in a Scene of Brigands as a fortune teller, and Jean-Victor Schnetz depicts her in the same way in two of his paintings, with The Fortune Teller, c. 1820, and A Gypsy Predicting the Future of Sixte-Quint, in 1826, of which he produced six different versions. The residents at the French Academy in Rome and the artists who revolved around the institution formed a tight circle.

Goya and Mel\u00e9ndez belonged to the same circle of enlightened Spaniards who were interested in social and judicial reforms during the late 18th century. Goyas innovative approach to portraiture is noticeable in the sobriety and restraint with which the sitter is presented. The bold brush strokes in Mel\u00e9ndezs collar and shoulders and the energetic handling of the paint are characteristic of Goyas style in the late 1790s, when he was preparing his series of prints the Caprichos.Melend\u00e9z Vald\u00e9s was passionately concerned about conditions in prisons and lunatic asylums, which were the subject of so many of Goyas personal works.  His admiration for French thinkers and reformers led him to co-operate with the regime of Joseph Bonaparte when he took the Spanish throne in 1808, as part of the French Empire. Melend\u00e9z Vald\u00e9s thought that the French would bring about reforms essential for the good of his troubled country.  When the Spanish monarchy was restored in 1814 he was accused of collaborating with the French and forced to leave Spain.

The sitter wears a shirt similar to those worn by the survivors of the Medusa. G\u00e9ricault captured the mans character with great sympathy and spontaneity; his watery eyes do not focus on anything outside the canvas but appear to express an internal torment.

The artist places the chapels in succession on one side within a solid perspective framework: from the Chapel of Princes in the foreground, with the large depiction of the Adoration of the Magi by the Vacca brothers, to the high altar and the chapels dedicated to Saint Alphonsus Liguori and Saint Michael. The view ends with the monument to Count Pietro of Savoy against the rear wall. The figure of a priest on a small flight of steps almost invites the eye to follow his progress beyond the vanishing point. Migliara captures the symbolic importance of the edifice for the history of the Savoy dynasty in his meticulous depiction of all the architectural and decorative details, and, above all, by highlighting the tombs of members of the family. Evidence of the artist\u2019s special relationship with the royal family is provided not only by this prestigious commission from Maria Cristina, but also by the award of a knighthood in 1831 and his appointment as \u201cgenre painter\u201d to the court by the sovereign in 1833.

Waves dash to pieces a barely visible ship in a storm several miles beyond Lands End, the westernmost point of England, guarded by a lighthouse called Long Ships. Aesthetician John Ruskin wrote of this drawing that Turner captured \"the whole surface of the sea . . . undirected, bounding, and crashing, and coiling in an anarchy of enormous power.\"  To convey the experience of natures turbulence, Turner used the full range of watercolor technique, from transparent washes in the sky to thick bodycolor in the water and rocks. He added highlights to enrich the texture and atmosphere, blotting the wash to reveal the white of the paper in the lighthouse and scratching directly into the paper to render the flecks of light in the waves crashing over the boat. With these bold techniques, Turner came close to modern abstraction in his efforts to expand the expressive and stylistic range of landscape painting.  He made this watercolor for a series of engravings entitled Picturesque Views in England and Wales, published between 1827 and 1838"}, {"title": "Sketchbook with views of Tours, France and its environs", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9sDjXrBjdhGpEJ9QnOkzzE3RPiryNDAAb-XAaRjFCeFKsehGIM8FYgGfoDNA0xJkM3Djqfi80", "desc": null}, {"title": "Whalley Bridge and Abbey", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_zf6s-mHsz_asCZosXqflVelkZIDWW5R4CAtrjvmbZ5izXX5RWm-fkrhgLGaJKiK719W2YxA", "desc": "It could be Italy, but Turner\u2019s painting shows a bridge in northern England, with textile dyers and cows in the water.

His many study sheets, and his watercolours that are not unlike the works of British artist John Constable, demonstrate his insatiable curiosity for nature and its most dramatic effects. He nevertheless rarely painted pure landscapes, the number estimated at only a little over twenty. Landscape at Champrosay, acquired by Olivier Senn, a collector from Le Havre, before 1930, is part of this very limited corpus.Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix retreated to Champrosay, at the edge of the Forest of S\u00e9nart on the outskirts of Paris, in the summer of 1844. He noted in his journal the impressions inspired by nature during his frequent walks in the countryside. He made many sketches, which he then reworked in his large compositions. But he also painted more ambitious landscapes, demonstrating how important observing nature for itself became to him in his later years and old age. This proximity to nature can be felt in Landscape at Champrosay, painted with impressive energy and sureness of touch. His full, broad brushstrokes reveal a rapid execution comparable to that of watercolour. Light and fluid, the painting exposes the weave of the canvas here and there, like the white of the paper in a colour or ink wash. The colour is diluted to obtain varying degrees of intensity, and sometimes so liquid it forms drips and streaks that the artist makes no attempt to correct. The strokes are thicker in places, in the orange of the sun, the mauve of the clouds, and display a full palette of colours, from the brownish yellows and reddish browns in the foreground to the dark green and dark blue in the distance.Landscape at Champrosay is not only one of the few pure landscapes by Delacroix, but also, by its size and display of skill, one of the artists most ambitious and most personal artworks"}, {"title": "Alexander Maconochie (1777\u20131861) of Meadowbank", "artist": "Sir Henry Raeburn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Y6g4nF5CyD01qrQUaShgP8_QteJOcNDS87XIvQDY3NXB1zIT6hSYzWMBDfYINqsoWPbBC", "desc": null}, {"title": "Chelsea Pensioners Receiving the Gazette Announcing the Battle of Waterloo", "artist": "Sir David Wilkie", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-IC_ELn9o0vqARb9-wsEmfimKHmsvjTrekXva29fURt1KAj5szd7Fe0crJ5eLz2RtVa7ux5Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "William Forsyth (1749\u20131814)", "artist": "Sir Henry Raeburn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9UwROA8-5gDZg-2AT6gP6UFocWxyaMNVpqvKAPZsiTIjCg43m1bs15tomjcEA21fJrDvgKt3Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Annual Girandola at the Castel Sant\u2019Angelo, Rome", "artist": "Joseph Wright (of Derby", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8kRHEm5pa-JurdUR7Ac0UFtq-RYsqVK7qQ12HIO0q--BxrX6z9aF-dmdqPmRkeeuNw_PZVH94", "desc": "The Girandola was a firework display staged in Rome, every year on Easter Monday, and at the inauguration of a new Pope.

After 1818 Lawrence was largely occupied in the major royal commission for a series of portraits of the European leaders who had combined to defeat Napoleon. The series was initially proposed for Carlton House, but George IVs plans for Windsor Castle latterly came to include a new room specially created (from an open courtyard) for the display of Lawrences portraits, the Waterloo Chamber. This portrait is arguably the most magnificent of that series. Luigi Barnaba Chiaramonti (1742-1823), elected Pope in 1800, was imprisoned by Napoleon in 1809 for opposing his plans for the annexation of the Papal States. After his triumphant return to Rome in 1814, Pius VII became a focus for the political and spiritual regeneration of Europe. Lawrence arrived in Rome in May 1819 and was accommodated in the Quirinal Palace. He was given nine sittings by the Pope. Lawrence must have recalled his great predecessors in the tradition of papal portraiture: Raphaels Julius II (National Gallery, London), Titians Paul III (Capodimonte, Naples) and Vel\u00e1zquezs Innocent X (Galleria Doria-Pamphili, Rome), as well as contemporary portraits. Here, in contrast to those examples, the Pope is shown full-length. His pale face, set off by jet-black hair, is made more vulnerable by the play of vivid red and white and the magnificent portable papal throne (the sedia gestatoria). With dazzling surface effects Lawrence portrays the Pope, a symbol in his time for the victory of peace over war, as a spiritual ruler with temporal power and all the trappings of authority. In the left background notable pieces of classical sculpture in the papal collections are shown in the Braccio Nuovo, created for their display under the supervision of the sculptor Canova, who had secured the return of the collection from Paris. The paper held by the Pope is inscribed Per Anto. Canova (for Antonio Canova).

Measuring up to these expectations, Ko\u015bciuszko led the insurrection. On March 24, 1794, he assumed the powers of the Commander in Chief of the National Armed Forces in the Market Square in Krakow, in the presence of the representatives of the whole society, namely the army, the merchant congregation, guilds, the clergy, townsfolk and peasants.

Here he made sketches that he later combined with biblical scenes to mix the genres of history and landscape painting. Although he primarily dedicated himself to landscape works, he pointed them up in a Late Classicist idiom by including scenes from the Bible. He treats the figures and the countryside as equals. The procession of the Magi is supplemented by mythological and genre-like ancillary scenes, such as Narcissus, studying his reflection in the water in the left foreground. Koch\u2019s combination of genres is the result of his having discovered Old Italian painting at the beginning of the 19th century. The view of art he developed as a consequence led to him emerging as one of the leading lights of the Nazarenes, who resided in Rome as of 1810. His attempt to rejuvenate art by resorting to old painting is also evidenced by the choice of wood rather than canvas and the preference for highly luminous paints.

The subject was popular in the early 19th century and reflected the increased interest in the theme of the family. By virtue of the additional motif of Joseph being instructed by the Angel, he was able to create a scene with four figures in a harmonious equilateral triangular composition that filled the canvas.

The open umbrella is there to keep him from getting wet, as the roof likely leaks. In Spitzwegs time, the umbrella was a fashionable accessory for middle-class citizens when they appeared in public, protecting them from rain and sunshine. The symbol often appears in caricatures of that era. Spitzweg painted a variety of umbrellas, not only in his three versions of The Poor Poet but also in other works. It is likely cold, and the poet is too poor to heat his room with the oven. He could use the rejected manuscript there as fuel \u2013 the Latin title on it reads \"The Third Bundle of my Works\" \u2013 but it will not warm him for long. Despite the adversity, the man is trying to write a new poem. He might have worked on it all night, as indicated by the candle at the left being almost burned completely. The books beside his bed and, the ancient poetic hexameter drawn on the wall at center, support him in his work. In this first version of the painting, the book leaning at the wall to the right does not have a title yet. In later versions Spitzweg added \"Gradus ad Parnassum\" (\"Step to Parnassus\") on the spin of the book. Parnassus is a mountain in Greece and home to the mythological muses. The title most probably is a reference to a textbook on Latin verses by Paul Aler (1656 \u2013 1727). The poet is distracted by a flea that he tries to crush between thumb and third finger of his right hand.

He then gave the painting to Clutterbuck. The two families maintained close ties throughout the nineteenth century, and the silver cup is still in the Clutterbuck familys possession. The painting, although it was paid for by the earl, also remained with the family until the Getty Museum purchased it in 1972"}, {"title": "The Reapers", "artist": "James Ward", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9djsPHb11rvF_cUZ1yjxSeNvsNLIUM_4gqCjNmlqfs4TAVF5bVu3vkXjMAZghwN9SehW0piQc", "desc": null}, {"title": "Job accepting Charity, from Illustrations of the Book of Job", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_TOgvqs1z4fwjP4hnCS1xUV82wtJ2R45HzkbZoO8ezrkrhTvzREp5KrnPYysrR3gywa8kSduT_", "desc": null}, {"title": "Basket of Flowers", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM892FLKu4PUzBaC_qnxtHqzUN867UoYrvqCeiHvEG-lYOKcuW-F_mMiEIKP0uQkKhv6_Djtew", "desc": null}, {"title": "Prostitute Soliciting a Fat, Ugly Man (recto); Young Woman Wringing Her Hands over a Man's Naked Body (verso)", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-97WpWKj1a_9-aGxxE6I55_oxvYNmdedAhTvqUwX0z_jOZoOc9JqhGMG4HENejz7vpOdbzoqXb", "desc": "Among the great figures of the pictorial arts in the West, Francisco de Goya is one of the very few whose work as a graphic artist is arguably even more important than his paintings.

Tones of brown paint near the bottom of the canvas give a sense of the seas violent power. On the foredeck of a ship that strains against the waves, a man stands in a white uniform and waves with confidence. While scholars are uncertain of the exact historical event Turner described, one probable interpretation is that the man depicted here is Dutch naval officer Cornelis Van Tromp, who was dismissed from naval service in 1666 after failing to follow orders. Van Tromp was reinstated in service and reconciled with his navy superiors in 1673.

Contemporary accounts, confirmed by Delacroix\u2019s painting, make clear that Paganini\u2019s appearance was strange, if not repellent. He was tall and thin, cadaverously pale, with missing teeth and shoulder-length black hair. In performance, however, he charmed, and his presence was electrifying. It was noted that he played with his right foot thrust forward beating time, while his garments flapped around his skinny frame. Delacroix\u2019s portrait of Paganini, the only one he painted of a contemporary celebrity outside his circle, shows the violinist in concert and is executed with an energy and brilliance that match the playing of its subject. The black-clad figure of Paganini is barely distinguished from the dark background, as he stands with his weight on his left foot, his right leg forward and bent at the knee. Light falls only on his face, with closed eyes, his all-important hands, and his shirt front. The line of the bow shines against the violin, itself barely discernible against the surrounding darkness. Delacroix, who was a great music lover and played the violin, wrote in his journal about the relationship between music and painting, comparing painted sketches and musical improvisations, and likened the act of painting to playing the violin. His portrait of the virtuoso, rough and sketch-like in its gestural brushstrokes and finish, is a perfect painterly equivalent of Paganini\u2019s performance style and a distillation of the romantic concept of genius. Duncan Phillips bought three paintings by Delacroix and a charcoal-and-watercolor drawing. Early on, Phillips admired Delacroix for his liberating effect on French art and for his expressive drawing and emotion-laden color, but objected to his dependence on literary sources. For this reason Phillips, who called the \u201cPaganini\u201d a \u201ctiny soul-portrait,\u201d considered it not to be a typical work by Delacroix"}, {"title": "Two Girls at the Well", "artist": "Eduard Bendeman", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9tk4ohK3AbI2c5f-oehLYwFydt2pkyQ6LUuEXP6C9Dhb1HpZkpNid4SaIVplUYMnTMO3SHmg", "desc": "Despite their close band, the two girls differ in terms of posture, expression and colour. The dark-haired girl with the lute is open, with an expansive gesture before the broad view of the countryside, and looks at the flowing water. In contrast, the blond girl, immersed in contemplation, is assigned to the detail of the well, with the plants surrounding it. Contemporaries read the painting as a discussion of different temperaments and art landscapes, and the interpretation could even go as far as to suggest what we see is the representation of the muses as sources of artistic inspiration.

He was born in northeast Spain and became a soldier in the cavalry, but he seemed unable to get ahead in the army ranks. It was only after meeting the future Prime Minister Manuel Godoy (1767-1851) that he began making steady steps forward in the world. In the collection of the Hispanic Society of America in New York, there is another painting by Goya that shows Foraster from the knees up. An X-ray examination of the painting shows that underneath the painting was a portrait of Godoy by another painter. As a favorite of Carlos IV, who reigned from 1788 to 1808, and his wife, Godoy was able to exert great influence over society. Godoy also collected paintings. In his collection, he had over twenty paintings by Goya, including his famous La Maja desnuda (Maja in the Nude) and La Maja vestida (Maja Wearing Clothes). Also in 1803 and 1804, he had Goya paint a series of allegorical paintings to decorate his home. It is clear that Godoy played in important role in getting Goya to paint this portrait of Foraster. There is no consensus about whether this painting is a study for the painting in New York or if it is a replica of it. In either case, this small portrait lacks the vividness of Goya\u2019s other work even though it was painted at the height of his artistic abilities.

His enormous enthusiasm responded to the world of literature where agony, rational nature, and madness are intermingling. The subject of this painting is a scene from the novel Don Quixote by Cervantes, the Spanish writer of the 17th century. The main character of this story is a squire of a village in the La Mancha province. It is the story that says: \u201cA man is so addicted to chivalric romances that he loses his sanity, proclaims himself as Don Quixote de la Mancha, assumes a peasant girl from a neighboring village as his lady love, decides to become a knight-errant to perform meritorious deeds, and set out on adventure.\u201d In this painting, the figure sitting at his desk on which he had a book open and indulging in dreamy thought is Don Quixote. Depicted behind him are a village priest, master Nicholas the barber and a housekeeper who are worried about him and burn his books, and the painting depicts that the three figures behind him are bewildered.  In the novel Don Quixote, in fact, there is no such a scene that is depicted in this painting. The scene in this painting is a sort of the summarized opening part of this novel which is the chapters 1-6: That is, Don Quixote, who is deeply influenced by chivalric romances, embarks on a journey but eventually is brought back home.  A lot of books and gears looking like knight\u2019s arms and armor are scattered about on the floor. With his back to the figures behind him, Don Quixote seems not to care about them with his eyes wandering.

Two years later, in 1810, G\u00e9ricault entered the studio of Pierre-Narcisse Gu\u00e9rin, started to take professional trainings. Besides G\u00e9ricault, the Gu\u00e9rin\u2019s studio produced some important Romantic painters including Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and L\u00e9on Cogniet. G\u00e9ricault, however, left the studio due to that he could not adapt himself to his mentor\u2019s strict disciplines of neoclassicism, and soon afterward, he started to devote himself to copying various great works by great masters of the past in the Louvre. Named as \"Napoleon Museum\" at the time, the Louvre became a treasury of famous paintings, thanks to the spoils of war that the emperor seized from all over Europe. Copying a number of great works of the predecessors was the best practical education for young G\u00e9ricault. His self-trainings came to fruition when G\u00e9ricault made a brilliant debut at the tender age of 21: His painting An Officer of the Imperial Guard Charging (Louvre Museum) was selected for the 1812 Salon, winning the gold medal. Even after achieving such a great success, he continued to dedicate himself to further study. He went to the royal stables in Versailles to draw various postures of horses with tireless and deliberate observation. And also, his sketchbooks were filled with the drawings themed on military. One can say that despite his short life of only 33 years, G\u00e9ricault could have left his name as a great master who embodied the essence of Romanticism. That may be because of the results of his intensive trainings during his young ages. This work can be regarded as one of his study-like paintings that were made at the age of around 20, when he started his painting career. In his oeuvre, finished large works are very few, but rather, there are many more study-like small works which attempted to pursue the same theme from various angles. This painting could probably be one of his representations developed under a certain concept that was themed on a valiant equestrian image. His attitude of trying to realistically represent strong feelings and strained movements is a very representation characteristic to the Romanticism. While G\u00e9ricault was painting the general of Napoleon\u2019s army, Napoleon himself was spending rapidly changing days both publicly and privately, such as the victory over the Battle of Wagram, divorce with Josephine, marriage with Marie-Louise, Russian campaign and retreat from Moscow. Meanwhile, in the art world, the Neoclassical and Romantic schools were competing in beauty with each other, creating a number of exquisite masterpieces such as Ingres\u2019s The Valpin\u00e7on Bather, David\u2019s The Distribution of the Eagle Standards, Gros\u2019s Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau, Girodet\u2019s The Entombment of Atala, and Goya\u2019s Disasters of War. Like surging waves, the art world was definitely rushing toward an era of Romanticism. It was 15 years later in 1824 that Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, a standard-bearer of Romanticism after G\u00e9ricault, exhibited Massacre at Chios at the 1824 Salon, which brought victory to Romanticism at the Salon"}, {"title": "Als de dag aanbreekt, zijn wij weg", "artist": "Goya, Francisco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_jmdBPeCA3jAy50O98GRhtYO5BabWUFOu_OcVAoEU_HayM5ET3i0q5EGMjukj2xHUz23fqew32", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Circle of the Corrupt Officials; Ciampolo the Barrator Tormented by the Devils", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-TX7zNjpn0VWjC04EAYSC-LbJpQ0uk1x7W4B08b8M_93_9AJpA_p6ObQtJ8rpgCugGjW2HJw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Vision of Eliphaz", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8B9ItHTsjIWdC_PRDcO4QAYTgg_fHkKgHPdgh6eQYtCxYld-84Clg6Yfc6InrImwYg4PQxvus", "desc": null}, {"title": "Evening", "artist": "Francis Wheatley", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-aLCwNlPvm_PA-JbLzRXo2zQ6GPqvjxOsnvp-QNiMFAzA5vuOlyn616HsaVZ5NhpUWO30xOvw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Caprichos:  Why Hide Them?", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8q9YxFF6uFIlzt8KkUYf1MYyINXAnGFzM5qH8W3YUK7Qq23U2uSSrg9EQaHJTr4abGONzeew", "desc": null}, {"title": "Lion Devouring a Horse", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_I1-530oGejsx4HtiMN_algcHLpuAMoauzwLk7dPzIPZ0NQMPXMZDl5NC4wrLPW5xjUj2M", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Edge of a Wood at Nohant", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9wgfRpKSVP0DdnFxxO_yIwa4imnYp6sQBOfoC7s5kwAhQkBge4t_b0vlPoYeQAFbj36WTwKxg", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Agony in the Garden", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_odfh638Almf4kfu00f6r8CEV_IeuR0lQ7vGGQJB1s83cUdjTfQZ4XIquWGKGigi8DB-qJNw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Morning amongst the Coniston Fells, Cumberland", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9ZffeUKC5cz1YG-QUkOw8GcvA8vkB5xbdWyACLHJgR6TTzf6b7EoH5Uxv9EJ3dayUpIdUF2ES6", "desc": "The mountain is Coniston Old Man, Cumbria, which Turner saw in 1797.

As a result of the research, it was determined that the composition \"Philemon and Baucis\" was painted by the future artist while he was studying at the Imperial Academy of Arts and received a small gold medal for it. During the 19th century this artwork belonged in the private collection of the collector Pavel Svinyin, but later the location of the work was unknown. The story depicted in the painting, borrowed from Ovids poem \"Metamorphoses\", is of Jupiter and Mercury, who roam Phrygia as pilgrims. As night approaches, the Gods ask people for shelter, but receive refusal everywhere. Only the hospitable Philemon and his wife Baucis welcome the strangers in their home. Orest Kiprenskys work depicts the moment when Jupiter and Mercury appear to the Phrygians in their true form. The wrath of the Gods is great, but their gratitude is great as well: the village with all its inhabitants is over-flooded, but the hut of Philemon and Baucis turns into the temple of Jupiter, and both elders become priests of this temple. The Gods also fulfill the desire of Philemon and Baucis to stay together forever: after death, they turn into an oak and a linden tree that grows from the same stem"}, {"title": "On the Washburn", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9inLZp7ZmsR13nDCQ9-LMGe_hjSY1XV_R0Ze_4yJ2kQxMnuDiMmnaGEB2h48TLyUoPM_OHcw0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Dr. Syntax, a Bay Racehorse, Standing in a Coastal Landscape, an Estuary Beyond", "artist": "James Ward", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-BppbdDcJnJU-ima29KIitDn-6rVX8eFluCfZbg-UvUgnBBPwpYnZcVxdXDkVxxttV3JcwXQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hamlet Wishes to Follow the Ghost of his Father (Act I, Scene IV)", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-lmpf7Z7OPkkGvF2-qd6Vmjr259VaeEL3skjQrxoTFaetRlAnqahHmVk37m-fsCsdThxfq", "desc": null}, {"title": "On the Washburn", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8kQofor5I0NATK3ryKAgrho86z-4gJTbXimMSSgFyFgskzPIUyMzqiXzGCwlHA-ooGeaGM4A", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Bard", "artist": "John Martin", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_xKa6sNjjZkHPW7maH0ochLBv4LPmnfmNRuTXvTrFhvIcRqxTMW6yDwaooHyR2P_ldcBrqX3jf", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ruin of a Norman Church", "artist": "John Sell Cotman", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8N-LVbVrW2GF5KsPHV0ls1NTAypDMav7wiaCHsBvFbWRHUfu5XYzBG6c6dooya4cuTMc7C6MQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hamlet: Ses v\u00eatements\u2026", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM81nBYnJi7d0xa3JbrXTUW-MtsnvSQcWw7MB7xh2Axnso1ik9ZlbiFENTFUgk70hdbvAailbQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Pedro Romero Killing the Halted Bull (Pedro Romero Matando \u00e1 Toro Parado)", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-yWP1WO2qnPEiSOtaEy9mdkQrS9ftiLC4P4TFUVRuQguuoUAoOsJ0BbRa-VryMIJvRjoX3Xzo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Norwich Cathedral: Interior of the North Aisle of the Choir, Looking East", "artist": "Miles Edmund Cotman", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM92vb3w2fD3TF6UC1Ob9AZ2nAWcKdWqxqCH2ddjteD32Fg8dPEPrIixpkn7wm2nb43mnJ-Rs0I", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins", "artist": "William Blake, 1757\u20131827", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_MHnZOtxsZUt5ZFu1A2Lrd19lSTneEJb874QYrm822qUpTJ2iQEh-RhI2s2Ckz8W4htK55bhM", "desc": null}, {"title": "Dandenong Ranges from ?Beleura?", "artist": "Eugene VON GU\u00c9RARD", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-y31nZmWW-zgsR1KzcmJhLgmX6Vt4wH_rKpZDlU4Kiu8OOLMMexcLdLOZhBlouqKct3Qyuxw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Spring Has Arrived", "artist": "Ludwig Richter", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9gW8nR3v8PGD9uTG5Jk-5upIShElTIBP4R213_YveLYG8j0hbfXTvjkTmAIIOv7RSK9i_a", "desc": "An illustration for a family picture book, this highly finished watercolor celebrates the arrival of spring.

For many years, he had been considered a harmless witty portrayer of familiar petty-bourgeois idylls. By contrast, the mountain landscape shows anything but the world of comfortable Biedermeier interiors and instead captures the sublimeness of Alpine nature. Compared to the sheer face of the cliffs in the shady valley in the High Alps, man appears minute and of no importance. The representation, which exists in several small versions and in later copies, focuses not on unity with nature but on a realistic appraisal of the threat to humans. Given the sublime, and the format (unusual for Spitzweg), the painting is regarded as \u201cone of Spitzweg\u2019s greatest\u201d. Moreover, the artist also shows painterly expertise in his treatment of the moody light and weather as well as the coarse cliffs, presenting them with subtle hues and perfect brushwork.

Here is an episode from A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream: the Fairy Queen Titania, bewitched by her jealous husband Oberon, falls in love with the donkey-headed weaver Bottom. She has flung both arms around the hybrid creature and, mad with love, has no inkling of the humiliation that awaits her. She is surrounded by her courtiers, a cloud of spirits in a variety of forms. At the top right, a mischievous face peeps out of the darkness, that of Puck, the Fairy King\u2019s henchman, who attends and executes his master\u2019s will. His magic potion will also prove the despair of the two young women, Hermia and Helena, emerging from the forest clearing: the potion\u2019s mistaken use causes their respective lovers to confuse one for the other. Fuseli spent most of his life in England, where he first tried his hand at writing. It wasn\u2019t until he was 30 that he devoted himself entirely to painting and drawing. He achieved renown as an English painter and is buried in St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral among his adopted country\u2019s celebrated artists. He developed his characteristic style in Rome, however, where he lived for eight years. He was unconcerned with such academic skills as the correct representation of a nude or a fold in drapery, the addition of decorative niceties, or the emulation of nature. What interested him were the liminal zones of the psyche, of fantasy and dreams, and his focus is on effective invention, drawn directly from the power of the imagination and permeating the soul of the viewer. The Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich possesses the world\u2019s leading collection of works by Henry Fuseli. This is thanks not to a legacy, although the artist was born in Zurich, but in large part to the museum\u2019s first director, Dr. Wilhelm Wartmann, who systematically collected paintings and drawings by Fuseli and mounted two large exhibitions devoted to his work"}, {"title": "Fisher Girl", "artist": "Louis Gabriel Eugene Isabey", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8mhZIDF3EPMZ7c9RPGwA-CNjWdybtEMRaSHlI1VTDEt5SwCUX6lEg5jqjWzDzvZJJj5eFFyg", "desc": "The girl in the painting is wearing the characteristic dress of Normandy fisherwomen \u2013 white blouse and dark skirt.

On the back or verso, G\u00e9ricault concentrated on bold renderings of horses alone. He practiced on four heads in the corner, while the central figures focus more on stance. The swirling lines that effortlessly suggest the head and manes of the animals blend into strong, muscular bodies with the addition of shaded lines.

Like many other artists, Schadow had moved to the Eternal City to study. There, he took over the atelier of Christian Daniel Rauch in 1811. Rauch, like Blechen himself, had been a pupil of Rudolf Schadow\u2019s father, Johann Gottfried Schadow. Blechen\u2019s oil sketch affords a glimpse of the contours of a sculpture through the door of the studio, this most likely being Schadow\u2019s unfinished work Dancing Bacchanal, which was left there after his premature death in 1822. Blechen\u2019s undated oil sketch was executed by the time the atelier was owned by Emil Wolff, a nephew and pupil of Johann Gottfried Schadow. It remains open as to whether this piece was painted in Rome in 1829 or in Berlin in 1830. Whereas the loose brushwork speaks more in favor of a hasty oil sketch made on location, the purposefully construed perspective and the subtle play of light and shade suggest a work that had been thought through in the studio. It is known that Blechen gave the oil sketch to Johann Gottfried Schadow as a gift in 1830. For the elder Schadow, this had particular meaning, for it served both as a memento of his own time in Rome and as a memory of his late son"}, {"title": "Font in Binham Church, Norfolk", "artist": "John Sell Cotman", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-mm2kM5OEAq8JtoexzZS6-StPvBs60PSmLpjg-itJ38WrMUY4qibs8F7z_aWhHDCYqwRkHlA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Otras Leyes por il Pueblo", "artist": "Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-NKPFZ9839znf-oCCIC9CdqpLP3p7NT8ZYs3dq5BT68egS1xk7hQM9ECqd703hf-lwdU6bszU", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Paraleytic Woman", "artist": "Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8qZP2V2s2LMQg9OVLmLcx6W4Igs5QCE28DhTjjp4zLvohBAL8hAgpI3Bub5DO390n5KoEXBA", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Poems of Thomas Gray, Design 51, \"The Progress of Poesy.\"", "artist": "William Blake, 1757\u20131827", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_dMChmblo4HkkwEpMiV9qXFvDd5IoRQqUODlA4mTWq8E7TIMJhzyp2AJgUjE89cCyDXDahslA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hever Castle, Kent", "artist": "John Sell Cotman", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Jc0VMZsNFLpd40zyJZhaKpF6cLf6dwzEYILU4BZIGKi1hoapXBR9BlP-6YswhthHrSFSnEg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Mannen in zakken", "artist": "Goya, Francisco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9dX2SgC1HS3908WJ7H7Z9PmNQFRc-vBwDKOHsTkjcMnAXFE6-ydE3BW0pTZxXuao1WdaCV", "desc": null}, {"title": "Laundresses before the Wasserturm, Nuremberg", "artist": " For more information about this and thousands of other works of art in the NGA collection, please visit\u00a0http://www.nga.gov/", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-PBp0DUDF51LQzBkZDQFaiK5vnDP5y8iRyTRwuAu_n599Vmgz7GfwJJ2S9UrqKmsMaK7Cy", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ziet hoe ernstig zij zijn!", "artist": "Goya, Francisco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_9HazYHkBiMzqjTYesPVJKEixUINN6x_knf78ijTWAP-qFmy51qOSrT0utPdqPFV8Zcj4YRQ4", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Circle of the Traitors; Dante's Foot Striking Bocca degli Abbate", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8cJ3jaiw-xNCHReSZsd53i-azKkn_V2z7xaw0G92jppqLVbZ-4lblCZmlPB_UI1Xd9GHO0twQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Plate 38 from 'The Disasters of War' (Los Desastres de La Guerra): 'Barbarians!'

The theme of the window, with the figure seen from behind looking out from the dark at the free countryside bathed in sunshine, was borrowed from the work of Carus\u2019 friend and role model Caspar David Friedrich. Carus accords the viewer a position in the lower section of a gondola on the Elbe that is heading for the bluish silhouette of Dresden, depicted with architectural accuracy. The section chosen intensifies the intimacy of the moment and the focus on the city, which can be read as representative in general of the yearning for an ideal place. Carus opts specifically for the use of strong light contrasts (the dark hull of the ship and bright nature) and to reproduce the attendant effects on our perception; as a Romantic painter, physician, philosopher of nature and artist he had, after all, a holistic and scholarly interest in natural phenomenon. He makes use of the longstanding metaphor of travel by boat to highlight the relationship between man and world.

In 1776, the year this portrait was painted, she married John Brisco (1739\u20131805). At this time, Gainsborough was one of the most fashionable portrait painters in London. As no companion portrait of Lady Brisco\u2019s husband was painted by Gainsborough, it\u2019s possible this portrait was commissioned by her parents to celebrate the engagement. Thomas Gainsborough commonly portrayed his sitters in up-to-date, fashionable attire, which he felt assisted in achieving a likeness. However, in this portrait, Lady Brisco wears a shimmering silver gown with gold trim, which references classical draperies while retaining a contemporary late 18th-century silhouette. In this way, the painting is Gainsborough\u2019s response to the timeless \u2018Grand Manner\u2019 style of portraiture encouraged by Sir Joshua Reynolds. However, Lady Brisco\u2019s elaborate hairstyle - piled high, powdered with milled wheat starch and ornamented with an ostrich feather - was quite literally at the \u2018height\u2019 of fashion in the 1760s. Lady Brisco\u2019s figure appears somewhat elongated, likely because Gainsborough intended to exhibit the portrait at the Royal Academy in 1777. The slight distortion of the sitter\u2019s proportions was a pragmatic response to crowded displays at The Royal Academy\u2019s annual Summer Exhibitions, in which full-length portraits were hung high on the walls and were therefore viewed from below. When seen from this angle, Lady Brisco\u2019s figure would appear foreshortened without the artist\u2019s subtle adjustment to the proportions.Lady Briscos wealth was derived largely from the proceeds of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. She inherited several estates across St Christopher Island \u2013 present day St Kitts \u2013 which was then part of the British Leeward Islands colony. By her father\u2019s will, she inherited Shadwell Park, Westhope, Grange and Salt Pond estates. Named tenant-for-life, she was entitled to the entirety of the income from these plantations. Her husband John owned a 1,008 acre estate named Priddies Salt Pond in the south of the island, the profits of which Lady Brisco also received upon his death in 1804.Overlooking London\u2019s Hampstead Heath since the early 17th century, Kenwood House was transformed in the 18th century into a grand neoclassical villa.

He subsequently gave it to his wife Clara who displayed it in her famous and much frequented salon in Milan. The work adds a fictional element to a historic episode, which at the time had become familiar through literary works: the tragedy Antonio Foscarini by Giovan Battista Piccolini, published in Florence in 1827, and the French novel Foscarini ou le patricien de Venise. Valenza Gradenigo, guilty of having attempted to save the man she loved \u2013 Senator Antonio Foscarini, condemned for treason in 1662 \u2013 is led before the Venice Inquisitors who include her father, the inflexible judge depicted in the centre of the room. Set against the skilfully studied theatrical setting of the scene with its contrasting figures and calibrated light effects is a silent dialogue of glances and expressions exchanged between the characters: the father\u2019s stern composure, the furtive glance of the servant supporting the woman, the scornful expression of the young judge. Valenza Gradenigo before her Father the Inquisitor, the first version of the painting executed in 1832 for the Milanese notable Antonio Patrizio, in the small format of an anecdotal painting, was donated to the Brera Academy in 1900, and is now in storage at Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo, while the later versions of the same subject dating from 1845 are lost. This second version was particularly popular with both critics and public, and Pietro Bagatti Valsecchi made many prints of it as well as enamel miniatures on copper and porcelain. This initiated a trend towards the depiction of obscure and tragic Venetian historical episodes in history painting, which were often replicated in different versions such as The Last Meeting between Jacopo Foscari and his Family Before Being Sent into Exile, also in this collection"}, {"title": "Lads making ready", "artist": "Francisco Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-cyYzRXQcBe876O8cgh28t_SHbmkley-MFd2rS2K2wOUKOEL1713hys_aCVmwWwZxE6Y_U", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Old Bridge in Devon", "artist": "Thomas Girtin", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM87YYWgmW_7ovoG2TYENw6KYGUENpoy-kXW2kvC5KNZSyU0OUQxSPQBDnyVJ6qPJ-9wJDwrb_w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Spring", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9JDJoglyYcd9Zek5ksxjy_A1fVgYqRh0ihOG3m0gb2hJr0umSgZe-A6lqg94ctJb2Ly2RrQZA", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Bouzols Castle Ruins Near Puy en Delay", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Isabey", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Bv1QyqmvHmK9HLT_Wx39zDTi4zOlc5fcK20e1AqLaCyBlWf1F36-Zk4wi0tEETbkgOn3V2A", "desc": null}, {"title": "Winter View of the Courtyard of a Medieval Castle in Ruins", "artist": "Julius von Leypold", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_nPC1G1L0IgaibUMCEEWlwC3vcrsEUc-TXmHWA21rQN7BdfLcir0ZOEEwgqL9_h2hCJX0mcjI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Boy on a Ram", "artist": "Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM91s5_mSFbMcYVk4N7SN6SmHRtUHHtxMwt3I2nQjm3CD-i9KdkV7dx9rsmuCLUccZ94_4zNTA", "desc": "As a painter to the king of Spain, Francisco de Goya produced designs for tapestries for the royal residences, to be woven at the king\u2019s tapestry works.

Still, he may have actually seen an Eskimo. In 1825 a Paris newspaper reported that an Eskimo woman and her dog were performing in the city as part of a curiosity show.

Circassians are an ethic group that reside in the region along the coasts of the Black Sea in Ciscaucasia, where is located at the foot of the Caucasus mountains on the border of Europe and Asia. In the medieval period, many of the Circassians were sent as slaves to Islamic countries. It is well-known that they were used as Mamluks (slave soldiers) and established the Mamluk dynasty of Egypt. Despite the small picture, the free and flowing brush strokes, pink and blue tones of the sky, and brilliant, jewel-like colors that are seen on this work fully represent the characteristics in style of the artist which were often seen in his late works. Previously known as Mamluk Cavalry, this painting was considered, without any clear evidences, to have been created between 1828 and 1835. The fact, however, is that Mamluks generally wear a Muslim\u2019s turban: In fact, such an appearance of Mamluk is depicted in the earlier works by Delacroix, G\u00e9ricault, Gros, Carle Vernet and other painters. In addition, the features of the Circassians are certainly reflected on the figures in this painting, but due to some imaginary elements seemingly added onto the figures\u2019 clothes, there is a concern remaining over identifying the figures as the Circassians with conviction. As such, an assumption can be established that it may be an original view that Delacroix created, summoning up his memories on views and scenes that were retained from his journey to North Africa in the first half of 1832. It is partly because in his later years, Delacroix was keen on adding his own unique artistic creation, as shown on this painting, when painting oriental clothes. There is a drawing, dated April 9, 1858, of the same composition as this painting. It is regarded as a preparatory drawing for this oil painting, providing a compelling evidence that this work was created around 1858"}, {"title": "Hereford Boar", "artist": "James Ward", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8mkFEE06QAbqMkCa1pj3NNqJtKktWkdH_0kpxRO6XH15gxF3MX1TB0ydnCWvEmH99PzZQkrw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Plate 68 'Los Caprichos': Pretty teacher!

Two paintings owned by Rizzoli were shown in the exhibition, both of them depicting the Piazza del Duomo and catalogued and reproduced in the 1937 monograph on the artist by Arturo Mensi. The earlier one, dated 1819, shows the side of the cathedral with a portion of Palazzo Reale, the second version, dated 1828, with the fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral framed by the Coperto dei Figini in the foreground and the Rebecchino building and Palazzo Reale in the background. This view constitutes one of the most emblematic images of Piazza del Duomo in Milan before the demolition and redevelopment undertaken in the second half of the century. The subject is identical to that of the work in the Cariplo Collection, and it may be the canvas shown with the title The Piazza of the Cathedral, Milan in the 1930 exhibition of Italian art held at the Royal Academy in London and curated by Ugo Ojetti and Adolfo Venturi. However, research to date has not been able to identify with certainty the painting in the Cariplo Collection as the work formerly owned by Rizzoli. The perspective view catalogued in Arturo Mensi\u2019s monograph, in fact, was executed in oil on canvas and bears the artist\u2019s signature and the date \u201c1828\u201d. The inscriptions on the work in the Collection are no longer visible, perhaps they were removed when the canvas was relined, which also altered its size. During this restoration work, carried out prior to purchase, the stretcher may have been replaced by another antique one, as suggested in the entry for the painting Monastery, since the label from the 1937 commemorative exhibition is also missing. Moreover, close examination made it possible to identify the particular method the artist adopted to execute the various identical versions of his works. Arturo Mensi had already pointed out this technique in 1937 with regard to other works Migliara reproduced in series, including the Venetian Church at the Carrara Academy in Bergamo, a replica of the version in the Cariplo Collection entitled Venice, Square with Church and Canal. The critical debate has been reopened by the recent discovery in a Milanese private collection of a view of Piazza del Duomo in Milan identical to the one in the Collection, though it is executed in oil on canvas with a more refined pictorial technique, and signed and dated on the back \u201c1819\u201d. In fact, this painting may be the prototype for the subsequent reproductions, including the one in the Collection, and for the numerous miniatures, the most famous of which is documented as being in the Carmen Ferrero Collection in 1937. Migliara began to paint this subject in 1812, when he made his debut at the Esposizione di Belle Arti di Brera showing four views of Milan depicting Porta Nuova, the atrium of Sant\u2019Ambrogio, Piazza delle Erbe and Piazza del Duomo, and the same subject appeared later in the 1817 exhibition. The Piazza del Duomo exhibited at the Societ\u00e0 per le Belle Arti ed Esposizione Permanente in 1957 definitely dates from that period, since the work still features the small figures in the manner of the 18th-century typical of Migliara\u2019s youthful production, but it already has the perspective scheme of the later versions. The version in the Cariplo Collection, like its 1819 prototype, marks a turning point in his oeuvre when he created a new pictorial genre for the time, in which he combined scenes from contemporary life with a faithful depiction of some of the most chracteristic places in Milan, a genre the press soon labelled \u201curban painting\u201d. This interpretation of Piazza del Duomo as the hub of the city, to which all the social classes gravitated, became extremely popular and was still very well received by the critics when it appeared in the Esposizione di Belle Arti di Brera in 1929, many years after the subject was first executed. This repetition of the same image was a constant throughout Migliara\u2019s artistic career. He initially chose to do this for commercial reasons to meet the demands of the market, but later for research and study purposes. This method may also be linked to the use of the camera obscura, adopted at the time for replicas of perspective paintings. Migliara must have been familiar with this instrument, which had been used since the mid-18th century by Venetian masters, whose vedutas were painstakingly copied by the artist ever since the outset of his career"}, {"title": "Portrait de Charles de Verninac", "artist": "Ferdinand-Victor-Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url":

(originally F\u00fcssli), a man of extreme erudition, was one of the most influential figures of the cosmopolitan art world of the 1800s. The eight years he spent in Rome (1770 \u2013 1778) were decisive in his becoming an artist. In 1780, he settled in London, where he was equally at home in literary and art circles. Although he was the one to translate into English Winckelmanns influential Reflections on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture, a standard work on the aesthetics of Neoclassicism, his own visionary paintings and drawings make him a representative of the pre-Romantic Sturm und Drang. A great many of his works were inspired by literary masterworks, the writings especially of  Homer, Dante, Shakespeare and Milton. His vivid imagination and eccentric visions were responsible for an extremely original art, in which the borders between fantasy and reality become indistinguishable. His contemporaries were equally enthusiastic about his paintings, his theoretical writings and academic lectures.His drawings, among which representations of his wife, Sophia Rawlins, form a distinct group, are very diverse both in subject and technique. In his late forties at the time, the painter married the exciting beauty, a professional model who was about twenty years his junior, in 1788. The artist depicted his wife in innumerable forms, views and costumes: she now appears as a kind, caring woman, then as a demonic femme fatale. Common to all the representations is that Fuseli always paid much attention to external features. This is also obvious in the drawing held in Budapest, which is a half-length portrait of the young woman, who turns towards the viewer. Her hair, stacked up and decorated with ribbons, is immediately conspicuous. Fuseli laid great store in appearance, and encouraged his wife to dress, and wear her hair, fashionably yet originally. Hair had a special, almost fetish-like, importance for him. The hairstyle and the garment also help to date the pieces: the drawing held in the Museum of Fine Arts is similar to one dated by the artist and kept in the Zurich Kunsthaus, which suggests the former was also made around 1790. The composition of the drawings is also similar: the figure of the young woman is, in both cases, sharply distinguished from the dark, brownish mass of the background; Fuseli did not find it important to hint at the environment at all. He represented the clothes with a few bold pen strokes, the hem of the skirt dissolving into nothingness. Similar is the broad black ribbon tied under the breast, which emphasises the slim waist. The three-quarter profile, the slightly bent head and the mischievous look make the model in the Zurich piece more accessible than the frontal presentation of the Budapest drawing, in which the special coiffure practically envelops the head. The fixed look and the expressionless pale face emerge from the interplay of the moderately used soft rosy and brownish tones.. The masterly combination of pen and brush, and the restrained colouring, make this piece one of the subtlest, most sensitive works of the artist.Text:"}, {"title": "The Wish", "artist": "Theodor von Holst", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9zI8jrdO3HtPoR8Q_H4K-JWVo0yVvUdS1b-twawp52JbTdFbi27npcTZAAE4u5s1uRUKYc14M", "desc": null}, {"title": "Boy Giving Oats to an Unhitched Horse", "artist": "Theodore Gericault", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM87GjXTeV4FAs_StXTliR60c1yMaq_CW6PQ697O-HkLh1BCjfigiGo4ejC-VE1E7a4ciIo6-Q", "desc": "A giant of 19th-century French painting, Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault is commonly regarded as one of the founders of French Romanticism along with Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798\u20131863).

It was painted by Leonardo Alenza twenty seven years later, in 1835, and two years after the death of Fernando VII, at the height of the Carlist War, which forced to extend the agreement between the Crown and liberalism. In this context, the Academy of San Fernando carried out an official commission of an historical painting (for its annual exhibition) on the conflict of 2 May 1808, a fundamental reference for Spanish nationalism. / Alenza received the commission and he based his work in previous prints about the Madrid conflict. He focused the dramatic intensity on three characters: the Spanish military hero, the anonymous heroine and the evil French general, being the true symbolic subject of the painting the ideas of betrayal and deceit that the French people infringed to the country of Spain. / Considering that Alenza wanted to please the Academy, it is surprising his use of such a dark colour range, especially because the represented events took place in broad daylight.

The moon dominates the center; a dark band of color stretches across the foreground and trees frame the entire scene.  Although the imagery is atmospheric, close observation of the canvas reveals a degree of detail.  Like many of Blakelocks works this painting has a very high bitumen content that has precipitated cracking.  He worked with an extraordinarily thick palette, often applying his paints with a knife.

Facing it is a group of dwellings on a colonnade, where a merchant is selling his goods. The picturesque flavour imparted by the houses, whose eaves, and rooves are rounded off by gutters, chimneys and masts, is complemented by the skillful, almost anthropological, portrayal that Villamil makes of the different popular types who frequent the vicinity of the cathedral. Their clothing and equipment are reproduced with an acute sense of direct observation, having been sketched from live models by the artist in his notebooks. As the companion to the picture of The Corpus Christi Procession inside Seville Cathedral, it also suffered the consequences of reckless cleaning that eliminated a large part of its glaze.

Isabey conveyed the scenes drama through a subtle interplay of darkness and light. Dark sweeps of watercolor covey the looming storm, while white streaks of gouache suggest the faint glimmer of light on the horizon. The fresh, vigorous brushstrokes are visible in the tangled strokes that suggest the mounds of sand. The scenes free watercolor technique and dramatic evocation of foul weather typify the Romantic landscape.

Born Maria Dolores Eliza Rosanna Gilbert in Ireland, Montez spent her early years in British military outposts in India and was in her teens when, in order to avoid being married off to a \u2018gouty old rascal\u2019 of her mother\u2019s choosing, she eloped with a British soldier. The marriage ended five years later and Montez was publicly named as an adulteress. She then fled to Spain where, having decided to earn a living on the stage, she received some form of tuition in dance and adopted the Spanish-sounding name. She made her London debut at Her Majesty\u2019s Theatre in June 1843, but soon fled again, performing in Berlin, Warsaw and Paris and attracting praise and scandal in equal measure. By 1846 she was in Munich, where she added King Ludwig I of Bavaria to an already impressive inventory of lovers. The relationship with Ludwig ended in 1848, when he was forced to abdicate amidst growing unrest at Lola\u2019s political influence. After five scandal- packed years in California, she came to Australia in 1855 and performed in Sydney and Melbourne. Metropolitan audiences were scandalised by Lola\u2019s routines, particularly her \u2018Spider Dance\u2019, in which she enacted having a spider caught in \u2018an extremely short gauze skirt\u2019. Despite being denounced as immoral and \u2018utterly subversive\u2019, Montez went on to play to packed houses in Adelaide and was loved by the less discerning audiences in Ballarat, Bendigo and Castlemaine. Montez left Australia in 1856. When her stage career stalled the following year, she toured America and Britain delivering a series of lectures on beauty and morality. She died in New York from syphilis- related symptoms in January 1861. Purchased by the National Portrait Gallery in 2010, this portrait of Montez was initially thought to have been painted by the German artist, Friedrich D\u00fcrck (1809\u20131884). However, research by one of Montez\u2019s biographers, Bruce Seymour, now indicates that it is one of two commissioned by King Ludwig I from Joseph Stieler (1781\u20131858), who painted thirty-six portraits for Ludwig\u2019s \u2018Gallery of Beauties\u2019 at Nymphenburg Palace, Munich, between 1827 and 1850. Stieler\u2019s second painting of Montez, completed in 1847, is displayed at Nymphenburg and is the most famous portrait of her. Montez sat for this portrait around the same time, but the end result was not to the King\u2019s satisfaction. Ludwig is believed to have given this painting to Montez who took it to England where it was sold in March 1849"}, {"title": "In twee\u00ebn gedeelde stierenvechtersarena", "artist": "Goya, Francisco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_Cju2tEkfugtSAt5p8uuRPYOG4UcBH83FvIRh-fCM2Te4Feb9ufodo4MW5nKMVp0bsmvVDdg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Plate 79 from 'Los Caprichos': No one has seen us (Nadie nos ha visto.)", "artist": "Francisco de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-7VRl6raNRHn_iVMvt0BN5H-255tVrAlZ3Q7IF-nB6hatsxPO5fq5GOiPufLo7kQjyDJ3FjA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hampstead Heath looking West towards Harrow (II)", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8B8ZaW3DTOW8MtiKl3HLIoyUkJv09lNJ2x4M3t2raJtBHnxtAb5R1MRLW48bFXADoZRqGsy3Dy", "desc": "Hampstead Heath was only a short walk from Constables London home.

In 1803, having become Baron Hawkesbury, he was elevated to the House of Lords, serving as home secretary and later as secretary of state for war and the colonies. Having assumed the title Earl of Liverpool on the death of his father, he became prime minister in 1812. Events during his leadership include the overthrow of Napoleon, the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the war of 1812 and the implementation of the Corn Laws in 1815.

It is the Rh\u00f4ne Glacier. In this painting by the Zurich artist Johann Heinrich W\u00fcest, figures can be seen approaching the overwhelming natural spectacle with a mixture of awe and curiosity, keen to explore it further. While some walk towards it, others seek to capture it through painting or drawing. Yet they remain peripheral, their function to emphasize the relationships of scale in the picture. The discovery of the Alps as subject for art was initially due less to artists than to writers. For Jacob Bodmer and his circle in Zurich, the Alps became synonymous with the sublimity of creation. Their preferred subject was the mountain ranges, their size dwarfing all human dimensions, glaciers of colossal extent and bottomless chasms. In this painting we encounter nature not only in the riven masses of ice but also in the dramatically clouded sky. Dark storm clouds tower up at the high horizon, leading our gaze upwards to lose itself in the tender blue of the sky. The Enlightenment prompted a fundamental scientific reinterpretation of the natural environment, one that informs our thinking to this day. Research expeditions and the publication of numerous works on the subject bear witness to this new understanding. Yet against this backdrop, art also evolved a romanticizing exaggeration that not infrequently culminated in gushingly religious pathos. Today, the painting acquires an additional dimension through the retreat of the glaciers, previously perceived as an immutable element of the Swiss Alpine landscape"}, {"title": "He Will Not Laugh (\"Y el no se rie\")", "artist": "Leonardo Alenza y Nieto", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_VggoLpILbmeIparvHfNU8iuIcbu1vf8Wm15Sx0QoNoqkBbEhM_t_7I1KS2lOV9xVt_OUunrA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Vue de Bologna", "artist": "Richard Parkes Bonington", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-BKVd9e5qC92BydNzT0YRJ6KeBaBcsIWkZsNH70a-6WKQUBu1e1CPjtrP-f4e8Iuq_slFqbA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Larderole Castle", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Isabey", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9VBxlMQLIjLk2DXNvaPCVEnpgUBM3MD99KMoT66YE9B9gN1UO2_bO9D9P6zeQ2g0PO6fjdUg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Two Dapple-Gray Horses Exercising (Deux chevaux gris pommele que l'on promene)", "artist": "Th\u00e9odore Gericault", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM99D6PG7Fa2QBnBO3N107KeiucQGyPb6Vty8JIWiIJcqp0YoI8R-u1FjONVGhJk-uhb-EO3lsY", "desc": null}, {"title": "Cheval sauvage", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-TCueVNwNLOHDTQ8cPXWvnMUugluYZ6NGdNn1LoGBqh8Zzbkzre31JDiNhLEoz5yOsH75XdHE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Branch Hill Pond, Hampstead Heath", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-HDs_NeiniMyQJ9mSt1AGszzGXTxVDwct-iL_nHRbxDfsr8CJdYBNuvWX_vX2HQwil_IC7Cr4", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Turk Saddling His Horse", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_M0FrRqXEAJf49-If9PG8c_wPlvKSkuL4NNjYX-WNQOFbzX4bF1_L_G9LZaq_pOPXooUsaFWU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Christmas (Folding the Last Sheep)", "artist": "Samuel Palmer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Xd9XR6dn7lkqXj0N8roQVj1Z0UNdnilw1rbA9iP9SOcZFh-z3ufvbFaQmZfX6jQkrPGp4qTU", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ch\u00e2teau de Larderole", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Isabey", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM96iJ0OK56KEgV0VdFWqkMH2xypIjSlTNk2lfLadsHkOOx0OZTtLmLGeIQoiuQaJ0AvCqyLsSc", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Religious Procession", "artist": "David Cox", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-3BysHsJVPI-r7eRmQFofIcOXnOfI9qVOCSpCNBf0PZN_-9YitdQ_t6-M__ygJI3qFcJeDcA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Caprichos:  It is Better to be Lazy", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Uq6CESLQPn3gw6eTZ49C_5ZgPOZtHiEk0QENsR7O-p5gE18yPo26ISgCtlPB6h7L-Wu7v_mI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Lion devouring a horse", "artist": "Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-hK1saH4LTm7CcxR6pXs43ho7GSAGqjhXWiRO78Q8JKVdVW4lmDbY3z1swvdgaYIxyloniYLjn", "desc": null}, {"title": "Galleria di Sopra, Albano", "artist": "John Robert Cozens", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8BN_OJvSA53OfMMVGDzKNmjL-60TOifiDQ451dpCtPr3fv13OXgVJLEHX6l7tLbGYRnnGIAg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Terugkeer uit Rusland", "artist": "G\u00e9ricault, Th\u00e9odore", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8KwS8hhhjDS2DtYHkPeCvCNHcpDeL4LFB6MxOgEBp5A-cvl0E2-41716Bqg7F6MIvmrAfbA0Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Horrors of War:  They Don't Like It", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-SQ19sx7TvOQyh7vvXVauyhMjnjWBO0x0kFD9c7IjE7hLKRkPlsYwCJc5zgC4_fsqN-fnF5Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "Villeneuve-les-Avignon", "artist": "oil paintings", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_dx_zRQA4V6klb96tf92ecdObEwtwLvPlhVXSg8LWZy_KIQnsKP00l8eVaEi7nhnX6dRGIKOM", "desc": null}, {"title": "Plate 70  from 'Los Caprichos': Devout Profession (Devota profesion.)", "artist": "Francisco de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8oLjye-Kb7k7pCTicI7-rgFtn_5zCkRGU0V90pqhuCR8Tm_q3nFfJCSvkZ0A24gYS-nePH_Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Forum, Pompeii, with Vesuvius in the Distance", "artist": "Christen Schjellerup K\u00f8bke", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9SiiuVYNpkzifs4fhTboXT-IyWUPPYhY_KP4Ys_veAEToMidNte1VC7KRXW6_Wd_mNtcwvuJM", "desc": "Under a brilliant, clear blue sky, a sense of stillness and abandonment prevails in this scene, reinforced by creeping vegetation, grazing goats, and lizards scurrying across a dirt path.

The viewer\u2019s dilemma\u2014deciding upon the meaning and significance of the scene\u2014is echoed by the woman herself who gazes toward the evening sky.

Francisco Jos\u00e9 Goya y Lucientes here referred to the mythological story of Pygmalion, the legendary king of Cyprus who fell in love with a statue. According to Ovid, Pygmalion carved the statue from ivory with wonderful artistry. Every night he prayed to Venus that he might have a wife as beautiful as the image he had created. Finally, the goddess caused the statue to come to life. As Pygmalions wife, she came to be called Galatea.  In a possible self-portrait, Goya depicted Pygmalion with his legs spread wide, readying himself to take a mighty swing at the chisel, which is aimed at Galateas crotch. Leaning slightly forward, she looks out with a fearful expression. Goyas animated interpretation of the well-known myth is highly original and even mocking.

Taken from English Romantic poet Lord Byrons work of 1813, The Giaour: A Turkish Tale, these verses inspired the French Romantic painter Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault to make this well-known watercolor. The dramatic story of an Arab Christian living as an infidel within his Muslim homeland tapped the vogue for Orientalism, which stemmed in part from Napoleons recent campaigns in Egypt and Syria. G\u00e9ricaults choice of subject matter was also affected by his passion for horses, which he often represented with great sensitivity.   On a visit to England in 1820, G\u00e9ricault learned the British style of watercolor painting, which emphasized translucent washes that allowed the white of the paper to shine through. After faintly sketching the giaouron the verso of this sheet, he used the translucency of the watercolor to render the Arabian stallions shining coat and the dramatically lit sky and ground in this finished drawing.

A skilled artilleryman, he was promoted to general in 1801, then chief general of the artillery fleets of the Grande Arm\u00e9e. He played a decisive role in the Battles of Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, and Dantzig, as well as in the Spanish and Russian campaigns, in which he fought at Smolensk and Borodino. This last clash went down in French history under the name \"Battle of La Moskowa\" (the \"Battle of Borodino\" in English) and was fatal for his son. Later, Murat himself fell ill from exhaustion and grief while he was in Vilna (now Vilnius) before passing away in K\u00f6nigsberg (Kaliningrad) three months later. On September 7, 1812, shortly before 6 oclock in the morning and 93 miles (150 km) from Moscow, French artillery opened fire on the Russian positions camped south of the River Moskowa. The frontal attack left almost 30,000 Frenchmen killed or injured on the field, along with almost 50,000 Russian men. Despite the final cannonade of the enemys front lines, this battle didnt prevent survivors from making it to Moscow. It was around 1814 that Baron Jean-Antoine Gros commemorated the memory of the general and his son in a double posthumous portrait, depicting the moment of their farewells as described by Nicolas-Louis Planat de la Faye, a member of the generals staff. On September 7, 1812, before the onset of the battle, Lariboisi\u00e8re, dressed in his uniform as divisional general commander in charge of the artillery, holds his son Ferdinands hand tightly to his heart. Ferdinand was in his twenties and a lieutenant of the 1st regiment of carabiniers. They are both looking toward the troops, who are ready to lead a furious cavalry charge, where death awaits the young lieutenant. To the left of the background, as a discrete allegory of his fate, a cavalryman in a helmet holds the bridle of the young mans steed. This anonymous and cut-off figure, providing a sort of picturesque contrast, can be found in other portraits by Gros, such as that of General Lasalle. On the right, four other cavalrymen evoke the image of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, sounding the beginning of the battle. Stripped of all pathos and delicacy, this historical portrait carries a mournful grandeur. The disjointed silhouette and the aristocratic casualness of young Ferdinands pose continue to evoke those of the second-lieutenant Charles Legrand, whose posthumous portrait was painted by Gros in 1810 upon the request of the deceaseds family (Los Angeles County Museum of Art). Despite the fact that allegory was less and less in favor among historical painters evoking contemporary events during the Revolution and the Empire, these cavalrymen figures can be interpreted in both ways. Family effigies, this portrait takes on the role of private commemoration as much as it does that of a valuable example. Effectively, the image functions with stereotypes and iconographic conventions (accessories, insignia, poses, attire) that highlight the sacrifice made by the individual for the nation they are serving. However, by using slight deviations from the norms, the artist is also able to highlight the uniqueness of each model. The portraits historical dimension is confirmed through the context and narration of the event that made the subjects famous. The remains of the general and his son have been resting at the Saint-Louis-des-Invalides church since 1814. Kept for a long time by the descendants of General Lariboisi\u00e8re, this painting was donated by his grandson to the Mus\u00e9e de lArtillerie in 1889, following the retrospective military exhibition held in the same year"}, {"title": "The Discomfited Duellists", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8lFOGc7ptxb2zH4QnFlyGwppVkgNajvumOjCc_roz6nGru2d76qObddAOAGilnKOaZ8VzVtCc", "desc": null}, {"title": "Death of Goetz von Berlichingen", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8L-KyxEIIWBa3RKB9S67S0VCI9sud711Xsz6mSUgGPOZrYTOyJWcWG13GJuXZ3Hb0wpggqoR0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Caprichos:  There They Go Plucked (i.e. fleeced)", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8ru-656tMBjDq1rm_fQmWOyVNpYc06Hj9LQQyYKMhWdWkzqveTXzNVzyF3_5IgYPbXdSQcZ38", "desc": null}, {"title": "Isleworth", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_s7W_gYwP_maSU481ieKFpp3wU5uxqTPAcjH0CHLcwLI1b1peQhleTnr_PSZTCOgha2qSDVw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Dwaasheid van de angst", "artist": "Goya, Francisco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_nDTjBF1Pi_TaFNOReaCNUVZwJxoS_fbDzZIGc87_qI0_pPDIBebBHIa_Elhj2VTbQKSoqxnE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ruin of St. Botolph's Priory, Colchester", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-1Q9Zye9MeiHo5wVTSC7x36fGrUYN3IAK7WOWRMiLlZn_CImTIGklMqHWZ7KRySsaU8OX26jc", "desc": null}, {"title": "Faust: portfolio cover", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8W0TQKJ5xj4iE5Q-ayawpeyf2TlLulXL3_Fs9ho5L-vOvyVvfwVOTHdcmAt72AlTPqrZ3F", "desc": null}, {"title": "Eug\u00e8ne F.-M.-J.

Like his statues these works are noted for their energetic realism, Barye studied the anatomy of his subjects at the Paris Zoological Gardens.  From 1854 until his death he would hold the post of master of zoological drawings in the Mus\u00e9e dHistoire Naturelle, Paris.  The tiger seen here has a coiled muscularity, and is perhaps ready to pounce.  Attention to detail and accurate rendering of his animals was a feature in his paintings and sculptures alike.  Typical of Baryes watercolors the animal seen here is set not in its indigenous Asia, but rather in the Forest of Fontainebleau, which Barye visited and where he established friendships with many Barbizon painters.  Another feature of Crouching Tiger common among Baryes watercolors is the sense of human emotion shown by his animal subjects, and which is true of his animal bronzes as well.  It was his technical ability and his romantic spirit that made Barye very popular with the public.  Unfortunately none of Baryes watercolors were dated, making it difficult to say with any accuracy when this particular work was painted, a matter complicated by the oft-repeated themes and simple titles.

Mer de Glace, Mont Blanc Massif, also part of The Ruskin Whitehouse Collection (1996D0075). Ruskin spent five weeks at Chamonix in June 1849, a tour documented in multiple diaries by Ruskin himself, and in the diary kept by Ruskin\u2019s assistant, John Thomas Hobbs (Morgan Library, New York). The glacier is seen from Montanvert, the elevated viewpoint above the Mer de Glace, where Ruskin stayed. Mer de Glace, Chamonix evidences Ruskin\u2019s skills as a draughtsman and watercolour painter, and his increasing knowledge of glacier and geological science. It is likely that the outline sketch, overlaid with dramatic use of sepia and blue-grey washes, with brilliant white spotlights on the glacier and mountain silhouette, was begun in-situ but, due to its size, completed later. Ruskin\u2019s practices as a critic and artist interlinked, and he took the challenge of \u2018truth to nature\u2019 into his own work: on the 5th July he wrote in his diary that \u2018really my Chamouni work has been most disappointing to me \u2026 I can\u2019t do it yet, but I have the imagination of it in me, and will do it, some day\u2019 (Diaries vol. 2, Ed. by Joan Evans, John Howard Whitehouse (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1958) p. 404)..Ruskin\u2019s diary for August 1849 records many ascents onto the glaciers around Chamonix, led by the local guide Joseph Couttet. In his diaries and other forms of documentation \u2013 sketches, drawings and paintings - geological and visual observations are interlinked. Multiple forms of landscape knowledge emerge from observing the glacier in proximity: a practice of \u2018close looking\u2019 made possible by being one of the few visiting artists who climbed in the mountains, rather than observing from a distance.The writing of Ruskin and his contemporaries accelerated tourism to historically isolated areas of the Alpine region. He criticised mountaineers for \u2018[making] race courses of the cathedrals of the earth\u2019, anticipating levels of mountain tourism in the 21st century evident in queues to the summit of Mont Blanc (John Ruskin, \u2018Of Kings\u2019 Treasuries\u2019, in Sesame and Lilies, ed by Cook and Wedderburn (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,1865), pp 53-108).

Subtly graded shades of gray wash evoke the gloomy, overcast days so common in Germany in November, when this image was created. The drawing also conveys, in the artist\u2019s words, \u201cNot only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him.\u201d In the center of the landscape, atop the highest peak, a tiny pilgrim kneels in prayer at the base of a statue of the Madonna.

The small Bremen study in oil also stems from this period. It is not objective form he conveys here, but instead the overall impression that this seemingly random choice of picture detail made on him. The textbooks of the day on landscape painting advised beginning with the background when sketching, and progressing to the middle ground before creating the link to the foreground. Corot adhered to these rules. He distinctly shaped the dead oak in the background at the right before the radiant blue sky, whereas the other trees are, for the most part, treated as a freely painted, dark green mass of color, albeit suffused with light. He only sketched out the foreground, though he placed effective color accents by concentrating the warm sunlight on the split, withered tree trunk at the left and the weathered wall at the right. In doing so, he simultaneously illustrated the growth and decay of a forest left in its natural state"}, {"title": "Windsor", "artist": "David Cox", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8BCnKD5NfntLF2Agh-erjO_0CmNuvg9fUpImWx9SglIB6gL8WinQjfVPIFhKOiR1sXJfd0cFM", "desc": null}, {"title": "Plate 17 from 'Los Caprichos': It is nicely stretched (Bien tirada est\u00e1.)", "artist": "Francisco de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9VsVMlo8nbD-WrH1yNjoLGmoQ07yIlAC1IlPf984O10DsTtxJs9KNaRDXkux6fEhzI48LdzA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Donjon de Polignac", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Isabey", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_EaxVBbg6FNI1Df5V8bNTh-n_JT-F4q7BZaSneTb5adiFHl7E-zLsTiHZVnubhgJcASE3K1g", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Horrors of War:  And They are Like Wild Beasts", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9GQtWdNS6cOU7P3uYweBQ9Hjt7ZUUAvXk7Cj8yzyeea-sEQ9RodLCt9-ljPMYvbXci-TGuTu0n", "desc": null}, {"title": "Labourers", "artist": "George Stubbs", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9rVke_mxYJy-_rApHFLfqurAFBTNqW784OmRZy8NbkWssS5qvS2Eya4huZaqbiXyoU_Nq1zA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of Frederick H.

Drawing inspiration from Reynolds\u2019s style, with its allusions to the old masters, Lawrence dominated society portraiture in England. He was knighted in 1815 and elected president of the Royal Academy in 1820. His accession to this office no doubt prompted his desire to own the original design by Giovanni Cipriani for the diploma awarded to new Royal Academicians. Cipriani\u2019s drawing belonged to Richard Baker, who offered to give it to Lawrence. In return Lawrence volunteered to paint a portrait of Baker\u2019s great-nephew, Frederick Hemming. Sittings for the portrait were underway when Baker died and Hemming inherited his collection. Lawrence also coveted Baker\u2019s drawings by Raphael and offered Hemming a companion portrait of his fianc\u00e9e, Mary Anne Bloxam, in exchange for them.

Ruskin, this drawing was executed by Turner in 1845. The view represents the Lake of Lucerne at sunset, the golden light shimmering across the distant mountains, with the blue of the water and coast suggested by jewel-like colors.

His technical mastery, as well as his attempt to suggest the intangible, enabled him to achieve dazzling effects in watercolor. Despite Ruskins praise in Modern Painters, Turners later drawings and oils were not understood and were much criticized for their lack of form. Ruskin hung this drawing, along with several other views of lakes by Turner, in his dining room.

In this study with its uncommonly sure, free brushwork, Dahl captured the threatening build-up of clouds above the castle tower. A few touches of paint were all he needed to show the tower catching the light of the sun as it breaks through the clouds. The seething drama of the stormclouds serves as a Romantic symbol of the power of nature at the same time as being a perfectly neutral observation of meteorological phenomena.

Working with him, Goya executed <em>Woman Reading to Two Children</em>, where he drew densely with a crayon and then scratched out fine highlights on the womans arm, skirt, mantilla, and around her head. An onlooker described Goyas methods, \"Usually he covered the whole stone with a uniform gray tone and then removed with the scraper those parts which were to appear light. . . . Next the crayon was again employed to strengthen the shadows, the accents.\" Goyas portrayal of the childrens rapt attention and the tranquil figure of the young woman suggests that this charming domestic scene was observed by the artist in his own home. Goya was joined in Bordeaux by his companion Leocadia Weiss and her two younger children, Guillermo and Mar\u00eda del Rosario. Only seven impressions of this lithograph are known, all of which are now in museum collections"}, {"title": "A Summerland", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url":

This page from his \"Album C\" seems, at first glance, to be one of his depictions of working girls. This young woman, however, wears a fine dress, jewelry, and a rather coy hairstyle and displays a graceful, almost cultivated bearing. She is pretty, not vacuous, but her questioning gaze and awkward cradling of the jug betray her uncertainty. Goyas caption, the drawings title, tells the whole story: He admonishes her for playing at being a peasant, a practice then fashionable among the upper classes. Even as he rebuked this young woman, he flattered her, setting her alone and off-center on the sheet with a few pen strokes and a bit of wash to give her grounding.

He later moved there altogether. In Hampstead he produced numerous landscape and cloud studies that are fascinating for their lively perception of atmospheric conditions and for their spontaneous, infinitely subtle painterly technique. The admiral\u2019s house is romantically secluded among trees and shrubs, and touched by an uneasy light. The building itself combines the characteristic shape of English chimney stacks with an unusual flat roof that the admiral had had put on a few years previously. The house succumbs to the superior power of nature, as do the small accessory figures in the foreground. The force of the elements, the light, and even the damp breeze following a passing shower are palpable. The intensity of Constable\u2019s observation of nature readily identifies him as a precursor of the plein air painters. In this work he goes beyond the mere depiction of light effects, bringing to life the movement and texture of the clouds, the wind, and the damp air"}, {"title": "The Church of St. John, Peronne (Somme)", "artist": "John Sell Cotman", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8kKppQUAb5Dubyll8ef6sqN7Uzp40efc1gZApfJ7Znz82A-6LBfIS-YZpRj3RlPW1JyBA6oQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Sea Piece - A Rough Sea with a Fishing Boat", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9PTEO_DkPiIE78FbNblLOOcQyUVAlimG-V4mmF0RD86Lejd-sT7xl6hRYDmH-qJC8V9gE-_A", "desc": null}, {"title": "Caprichos:  She Prays for Her", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_JFWQQj2zvxhzT23vU9G41zn61qbbnKaeslajGINejxLq6vlWXKPaG0Oyp2jBTsS4XCb8UbfI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Stage Design for Heart of Midlothian; The Tolbooth", "artist": "Alexander Nasmyth", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM97D0dZecvVjvkMnlSqI4VYQmOB6jQvI3Dv9qukkOcxMEn0CkqC6vIkC1mNJ3dlePfe052UuA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Studies of Mount Chimborazo, Ecuador", "artist": "Frederic Edwin Church", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_7_k6Z7ia56Rqjp2giJVO8Gk-xKjCbqWWIloSlGWl7_wodyYl072QaO_v5ymU7kbdEeriCglg", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Book of Thel (frontispiece)", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-L_0nIuhieEqpGexu2Muou5pvptxHX-t2mI4ag41I6b112IinpL9FjBHP4KSfk5VEsy14rGcg", "desc": "During the early part of his career, William Blake experimented with a number of techniques until he found a form of expression uniquely his own.

The drawing also suggests movement and power: as the pair turn to the upper right, Chirons horse-body hurtles diagonally through the center of the composition.  In 1838, the forty-year old Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix received one of his most significant public commissions: the large curved ceiling of the Deputies Library of the Palais Bourbon. Completed in 1847, Delacroixs decorative program illustrated the themes of Philosophy, Science, Poetry, Law, and Theology. Related to the theme of Poetry, this pencil drawing on tracing paper, is one of several in which Delacroix explored this dynamic composition. It was conceived to accommodate an unusually shaped section of the librarys ceiling. Delacroix kept this work in his studio and returned to it more than twenty years later when he created a pastel of the same subject, also in the Gettys collection, as a gift for the writer Georges Sand"}, {"title": "Liber Studiorum:  Juvenile Tricks", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9mjgGIWPaHaCPrbv8cX4Y9trLZPFpZGf8H0YFtJuSsACu31KTYChLqKHN9Yir-mTfy3-Otv54p", "desc": null}, {"title": "Self-portrait", "artist": " Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_VtYMosVNDRqGA8A4aE5Ly4OZdt8mHSC6S6-N9tmiLYeHNRFgXOUvlh7jV1K0jKHxhfEoP8g", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of Madame Thomas (n\u00e9e Camille Boucher)", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Isabey", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_NSwkH7GC_H2BbBxw3r-8YR957p-zr94Q31GXYA5d2xTFjDZZLvAA2jXwUja6fcY28sf8T6b4", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Horse Frightened by a Lioness", "artist": "George Stubbs", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM99RmvONDnVntelY2RweFuH6iI1C4R8pVOYoJ8_S0V3XrmHpMJUNic0iOb_2ZrhWYdcIDsp5SE", "desc": null}, {"title": "Study for \"The Last of the Buffalo\"", "artist": "Albert Bierstadt", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-9UxyIQY6aOJDS2rvxiruxLNzMFNKQAGS5ubTMKr1qQTO3MYtyiVxM54-c7HMvaXK21udkUBw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Mer de Glace - Valley of Chamonix - Savoy, from the Liber Studiorum", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-WR9-ywmVfWM8mIzdeBoGsk84W79DFndRyfODPLmXjt9J3vQrhhQvpy17I61MiyQHAfNBXEpuu", "desc": null}, {"title": "Vue de Caen", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Isabey", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-EbWStYAuLaFKaeCPiteELJYhMeRkQOTIMvyKL0Ny25nGeZaoTwreziWU85kgoXvTS8dShZ6Q", "desc": null}, {"title": "Portrait of A.A.Chelishchev", "artist": "Orest Kiprensky", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8vQUT_ljhYrjgUp2epaXMjFycu6W2-zszDppkgaRKURWHxZgOWZj1fGM1Q8gMynZVJsqug-RY", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Apparition in the Forest", "artist": "Moritz von Schwind", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8yGgqY8X7OFs3oA1wuma7-bCDyZwkymToMpzW1vB31jeycqpSsrojl9klNi4PDcxsByazeXfI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Justice, Vengeance, and Truth", "artist": "Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Chifflart", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9WfjUrNlZqLCI1awLhx57-NDAfgVKiMOFbf1vGOex1DUtjnTy9FA1SsRDbGyyiSIbQlOLStQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Prisoner", "artist": "Joseph Wright of Derby", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8w8WQe1TBnBYTUvJAC25nMHkW1WjiHupMIQT36IFwipWiwnZ8VfEVy7t8zd7ixmWRvVlx2pA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Mlle.

Girodet had painted an earlier portrait of her that she found unflattering. When she refused to pay the agreed-upon price and insisted that the painting be removed from public view at the Paris Salon, the enraged Girodet sought revenge with this second, satirical portrait. Eighteenth-century artists sometimes portrayed people as mythological characters to highlight their virtues. Girodet inverted this convention to defame Miss Lange.

The raven symbolizes death and corresponds to the motif of sleep, the brother of death. The boy\u2019s body, tree trunk, and branch likewise describe the cycle of life and death, whereby the branch echoes the pose of the child. The unusual, angularly shaped ax, subsequently added, also conforms to this, fitting in with the broken nature of the theme. The drawing served as a model for a woodcut (Inv. No. 1933/19). It had been used for tracing, as the blackened back of the page, in addition to the outlines of the figure of the boy and the creases in the garments on the front of the page, reveal. The tracing was done with a hard, sharp pencil. In the woodcut, the boy sleeps leaning against a grave with a crucifix. Friedrich opted against the tree here and replaced the raven with a butterfly, which embodies the soul in Christian symbolism. Thus, the message of the Resurrection replaced the symbol of death"}, {"title": "Battle Scene", "artist": "Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9H0ZompHfK-3wzEwjtcbLnSqfUPxK_nYtZqTx9e7ql9ipaeum6kzSm28UC11z6SVilXTv8Wpg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Plate 10 from 'La Tauromaquia': Charles V spearing a bull in the ring at Valladolid", "artist": "Francisco de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM90gJ6H-c7ISy9vjQQww2jOuNiQTxJXqXMcXcSShyveUHP-KCQwP2z25G7rWBzjnK9tEURokQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landscape with a Waterfall", "artist": "Paul Sandby", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8RFNGD8o5ERuVUzvbNglbIw5QDAvDKX17CIR0Z61rSPA0TJ1I2WuZzYboZZnEr-h4aMJG8yfA", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Cutter and Other Shipping in a Breeze", "artist": "Richard Parkes Bonington", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8a8HJju5gKZ93lfiZUA7DuVbpVDzpcGYCVCyHV80OW8zYMsBzeRCs_tC6ccvQst1ThDMYmRxY", "desc": null}, {"title": "Underriver Hills, near Sevenoaks, Kent, from the Grounds of J.

As a boy the artist trained briefly with Benjamin West (1738\u20131820) and John Varley (1778\u20131842) before becoming a student at the Royal Academy from 1805 to 1812. Though primarily known for his landscapes, Linnell was also a prolific portraitist and executed miniatures during the first two decades of his career, learning the medium from his neighbor James Holmes (1770\u20131860). According to an early biographer, Linnell began painting miniatures around 1818 with a portrait of his wife. By 1823 he had executed a number of miniature commissions from aristocratic patrons, including Princess Sophia, facilitated by the praise of the society maven Lady Stafford. He painted his last known miniature on ivory in 1832. During the approximately fifteen years that the artist painted miniatures, he consistently charged between 10 and 50 guineas for a portrait. These fees corresponded less to the size of the ivory than to the degree of finish and elaboration of the composition.In this portrait Anne Law (n\u00e9e Towry), 1st Lady Ellenborough (c. 1769\u20131843), is depicted half length. She wears a high-waisted white dress of translucent fabric through which a hint of blue appears and around which she wears a black belt. A <em>devant de corsage</em> (stomacher, or bodice brooch) is worn at her d\u00e9colletage, extending to the belt. Its gold framework contains at least twelve semiprecious stones colored blue, red, aquamarine, pink, and brown. A gold brooch with a large blue stone is pinned to the cloak at her right shoulder. She also wears a twisted multistrand pearl necklace, matching pearl pendant earrings, and two gold rings on her left ring finger. A dark gray-green shawl with red reverse, gold border, and red fringe is draped over her shoulders and arms. She holds a closed fan in her left hand and stands against a brown background featuring a green and auburn striped curtain in the upper left corner. The sitter\u2019s fair hair is dressed in ringlets that fall at her neck. The miniature is housed in a standing gilt metal and red velvet frame that dates from the same period"}, {"title": "Spinners in Cervara", "artist": "Carl Blechen", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Ws8LlVgs4klMtu8WoFjb7B_JlLalIRmwJ0hE37mBmNMMa-AFrSAT2iwqytnMv2ZSbojRcExo", "desc": "Zu Beginn des Jahres 1829 durchwanderte Blechen die Gegend bei Subiaco.

The artists compositions were based on a striking formula of small figures engulfed by settings of awe-inspiring landscapes or architecture.  In the 1820s he turned to printmaking, first etching, then making mezzotints of his paintings.  Mezzotint, with its rich, velvety blacks and bright white highlights, was a medium particularly suited to the translation of the dramatic chiaroscuro of Martins paintings into prints.  Following the enthusiastic reception of a series based on John Miltons \"Paradise Lost\", Martin proposed in 1831 to issue a series of Illustrations to the Bible, intending to create forty scenes from the Old and New Testaments.  The series was not, however, a commercial success and only twenty plates, all from the Old Testament, were ever made.  This print, the fourth in the series, shows Adam and Eve rebuked by God, represented by the rays of light shining from the trees at the right, who asks, \"hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?\" (Genesis 3:11)"}, {"title": "Le corps de garde \u00e0 Mekn\u00e8s", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9EJNWPQg7JvVAsRax3O-e061RV4Nikifxb-tPSFK6xSNQMIWdxY_mQ7tvDFCUzqr-NM20_qv4", "desc": "De janvier \u00e0 juin 1832 Delacroix accompagna une ambassade fran\u00e7aise qui se rendait aupr\u00e8s du sultan du Maroc Mulay Abd-er-Rhaman ; il d\u00e9couvrit alors une nouvelle source d\u2019inspiration qui rempla\u00e7a l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9.

She grieves for the fallen warrior whose blood seeps into the ground from his fatal wound. He wears a suit of armor, and his sword and helmet lie at his side. The subject is taken from Lara, a poem by Lord Byron published in 1814. Lara, a Spanish overlord, returns from exile accompanied by Kaled, a young page of foreign birth. Lara becomes the leader of a peasant revolt, which is eventually suppressed by Otho, a hostile neighboring baron. In a final battle against overwhelming odds, Lara is mortally wounded by an arrow.

He was in service throughout all campaigns of the Revolution, the Consulate, and the Empire, during which time he earned several distinctions. Upon the downfall of Napoleon I, he allied himself with the Bourbons and refused to support the Emperor during the Hundred Days. Baron of the Empire in 1808, before being named a Count, Maison was appointed a Marquis in 1817. In 1828, he was named leader of the French expedition in Morea (Peloponnese) in support of the Greek uprising against the Ottoman Empire. Leading fourteen thousand men, he claimed the citadels of Navarino and Morea and executed Ibrahim Pashas mission against the Turks. Praised for his great success, he was raised to the rank of Marshal of France. It was at this time that his portrait was commissioned, destined to be displayed in the Marshals private quarters in the Tuileries Palace; the execution of this task was entrusted to L\u00e9on Cogniet. The work was presented at the 1831 Salon, where it was greeted with such positive feedback that critics lauded it as \"the best full-size portrait of the exhibition.\" The artist created a monumental portrait of his subject; the conqueror of the Morea expedition poses in a majestic fashion, proudly standing firm, in full-dress attire with gold details adding to his characters prowess.

Berjon sought to create illusion by painting life-sized fruit and flowers to a greater extent than the northern masters did. Each component can be precisely identified. A little fly has settled on the melon, making the depiction extraordinarily realistic, even though tulips and poppies do not bloom at the same time of year. Painted during the last few months of Berjon\u2019s stay in Paris, this monumental still life was exhibited at the 1810 Salon exhibition.

Although he may have inspired fewer successors than his contemporary, William Turner, he was a great master of his genre. He has often been called the \"great naturalist\" for his highly refined ability and sensitivity to present his intimate relationship with nature. He excelled above all in observing variable atmospheric conditions and faithfully reproducing them on the canvas. He loved the familiar Suffolk countryside, his native village and his home terrain, and frequently sought his subjects there. His attraction for nature and landscape was rooted in his childhood spent in this rolling English countryside, cut through by rivers, among his fathers watermills. His landscapes evoke this homely atmosphere, sometimes enlivened with charmingly observed everyday scenes, and sometimes only enriched with a village church or a tree whose branches lean over a reflecting river. The way the serene pictures of Constable convey subtle changes in atmosphere, flutterings of the wind and the warmth of the suns rays can be traced to the art of the seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painters and his great French predecessor, Claude Lorrain. Constable learned this style of painting at the Royal Academy, which he entered in 1799, and after completing his studies, during his travels to the English Lake District, formed his own artistic views, based on the direct observation of nature"}, {"title": "Plate 21 from 'The Disasters of War' (Los Desastres de la Guerra): 'It will be the same.'

Turner used quick, slanting brushstrokes to describe the stormy sky. The application of scumbled white paint suggests churning, turbulent seas and the heavy spray of waves hitting the ships bow. Tones of brown paint near the bottom of the canvas give a sense of the seas violent power.   On the foredeck of a ship that strains against the waves, a man stands in a white uniform and waves with confidence. While scholars are uncertain of the exact historical event Turner described, one probable interpretation is that the man depicted here is Dutch naval officer Cornelis Van Tromp, who was dismissed from naval service in 1666 after failing to follow orders. Van Tromp was reinstated in service and reconciled with his navy superiors in 1673.

His captivation in the properties of light can also be found in a series of small drawings he made in 1827 using a process he called \"dessin-fum\u00e9e,\" which can be translated loosely as \"drawing in smoke.\" The drawings may actually have been created with the smoke from a lit candle that was manipulated to create effects resembling light and shadow. This process is notable for the way atmospheric and linear effects are unified homogenously.The very same year that Daguerre made this dessin-fum\u00e9, he became aware of Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pces experiments with light-sensitive materials to record scenes from the real world and exchanged one of his dessin-fum\u00e9e drawings for one of Ni\u00e9pces engraved pewter plates. The pewter plates were made with one of Ni\u00e9pces earliest experimental methods from the 1820s. Only one of Ni\u00e9pces photographic images on pewter still exists today. It is housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Austin. Ni\u00e9pce and Daguerre eventually agreed to collaborate, signing an agreement in 1829. The biggest challenge they had to overcome was to find a way to \"fix\" the image; in other words, they needed to stop the chemicals reaction to light so that the image did not progressively become darker and darker any time it was viewed in the light until it was obliterated. Their combined efforts would evolve into the daguerreotype process. (See 84.XT.953 for an explanation of the daguerreotype process)Adapted from Weston Naef, The J.

I have stolen a lot of ideas from him,\" wrote the Romantic writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.   The well-known waterfalls at Terni, forty miles north of Rome, were a popular subject for artists, who often drew them as souvenirs for tourists. Cassas took the opportunity to depict natures might, a favorite subject of Neoclassical landscapists aiming to convey the concept of the Sublime. To ensure that viewers felt awestruck by the power of the rushing waters, Cassas inserted tiny people in antique costume gesturing in amazement at the spectacle.

The drapery swirling around the cross and the various gestures and expressions of grief emphasize the scenes pathos. The tip of a spear, the crown of thorns, and four nails on the ground beneath the Virgins hands signify the implements of Christs suffering.   Lehmanns strong vertical composition, with figures wrapped around the foot of the central cross, anchors the scene. In sharp contrast to the dark gray wash on the other figures, he used large amounts of white chalk highlighting on and around the Virgins face.

Considered a vital part of visual education, it often implied homage as well. This is the case with John Constables loving replication of Claudes Landscape with a goatherd and goats. The English painter took pains to evoke the spirit of his French original, not simply to imitate its surface appearance. Thus the Constable could not be mistaken for the Claude despite adhering to it in every important respect of colouring and composition. The result is an imaginative effort fascinating on its own terms. Constable wrote to his wife, Maria, at the time, I have a little Claude in hand, a Grove scene of great beauty and I wish to make a nice copy from it to be useful to me as long as I live...

The dialogue underneath the picture recounts the verbal exchange. Phaedra says, \"I am unworthy of pleasing you or being near you.

He became interested in etching because he understood its potential for spontaneity, yet he feared his etchings would not be admired because they were, by conventional standards, unfinished and sketchy. In fact, it is precisely the freedom of line, lack of rigidity, and open silvery quality of light that makes them so special and individual. Rather than using prints to just copy his paintings, Crome approached etching as a creative medium with which to capture the special beauty of his native Norwich countryside.

A portion of the photographic collection documents work undertaken by Ruskin in his capacity as the first organiser and cataloguer of \u2018The Turner Bequest\u2019, the name given to the collection of works by J. M. W. Turner bequeathed to the nation from his estate in 1856. Many more, including this glass slide of the corner of the Ducal Palace, Venice, are architectural views, and reflect Ruskin\u2019s concern to capture a vanishing world: \u2018just in time to save some evidence from the great public of wreckers\u2019 (LE  3 (1905)/210n). This glass negative is of a daguerreotype now in the Ruskin Museum at Coniston. This daguerreotype and a salted paper print copy are published in figures 216 and 217 of Carrying Off The Palaces. John Ruskin\u2019s Lost Daguerreotypes (2015), by Ken and Jenny Jacobson. This is the only surviving photograph of Venice showing the cannons on wheels and guardhouses fortifying the corner of the Ducal Palace in the late 1840s or early 1850s.The unprecedented objectivity and levels of detail furnished by the daguerreotype, the first commercially successful form of photography, provided new forms of visual and temporal record of \u2018great use\u2019 for both \u2018mechanical refinement\u2019 and \u2018legal evidence\u2019 (LE 19 (1905)/150). Initially, Ruskin described his appetite for this new technology as \u2018insatiable\u2019. He was astonished by its extraordinary accuracy, \u2018more valuable than any sketch can be by way of information\u2019, and by its ability to render gradations of light and line (LE 38 (1909)/341). \u2018It is very nearly the same thing as carrying off the palace itself; every chip of stone and stain is there, and of course there is no mistake about proportions\u2019, he wrote to his father from Venice in October 1845 (LE 3 (1903)/210n). And again a week later: \u2018I have been walking all over St Mark\u2019s place today, and found a lot of things in the Daguerreotypes that I never notice in the place itself\u2019 (Ruskin in Italy: letters to his parents, 1845, Ed. by Harold I. Shapiro (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), pp. 224-225).While Ruskin continued to use photography as a reference point and aid for his own work, his attitude toward the medium became more ambiguous: over the course of his career, he expressed contradictory and oscillating views of this new technology. Ruskin became increasingly vocal about the dangers and limitations of apprehending the world through technologies. Ruskin emphasized the need for a direct connection with what we see, arguing that \u2018this truth of mere transcript has nothing to do with Art, popularly so called, and will never supersede it\u2019; and that the \u2018sight of a great painter is as authoritative as the lens of a camera lucida\u2019 (LE 19 (1905)/150). Despite his lasting advocacy for \u2018the beautiful effects which the daguerreotype alone can seize\u2019 (LE 11 (1904)/312) Ruskin\u2019s enthusiasm for it waxed and waned. He argued that the hyper-accuracy of photographic representation made \u2018the eye too fastidious\u2019. Sometimes, because of the scale of the image, it even \u2018fails from over-fidelity\u2019 (LE 3 (1903)/603) to the point of distortion. For example, when miniaturized by the camera, the leaves of a tree will \u2018lose their organization, and look like moss attached to sticks\u2019 (LE 4 (1904)/312)"}, {"title": "Sir Brooke Boothby (1744-1824)", "artist": "Sir Henry Raeburn", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8tuUD8CimmHf6gkCCw8-9Vq37zjljcORBQP8fZKh1P_zHQdepY-hzgkK1zGEy8vLzMGVyIAW4m", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Channel Sketchbook", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-WAgqOBe-xDiAxH9uuiKB_vEvz-E-ilbtpkDC_I6nAkQz0lJmp6kI1njatys9LOMP0f0VXKWo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Study for \"The Siege of Gibraltar\" (Study of Lieutenant Colonel Lindsay and Figures Pulling on a Rope)", "artist": "Drawing", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8hUOB-FlDaEAUvoE1GLsppygGT5KFb3usRjUkvCg5c32k6vpqLo4pX0LYV5u-dtd-_f91wPg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Hamlet:  The Chant of Ophelia", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-e7zsh3llG-bncoDhES-JrS2NQlodHXmmwZsmN53EMKnNLF7odseC1OChb3PGyp2SDW-OMloIl", "desc": null}, {"title": "Death of the Strong Wicked Man, from The Grave, a Poem by Robert Blair", "artist": "Luigi Schiavonetti", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8rCbDDu1hDbsHkpbngNAx-jNiTg9iWdgmkBCTGvHM2PJhS7Sir-BCB_Vdujc7AXNOt0Dkbf8A", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landscape", "artist": "Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-37-YPXxz71VYKnARd888ewMSGyJA-4CcCjWrxn2JEMzI5VVy89nOPykUUSxUmn5hG3py9hQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landscape with Trees and a Figure", "artist": "Thomas Churchyard", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8-f2IWtghlycId8ggOlh3L4wU-fbowu4B_zDdsoV0hDWA1Nlmx0aHQId7Iq3sZmf5RSHFU3oo", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Chanel Sketchbook", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9rSbJVPLemzusGitKgIBSVCwUPZYgPHa_2eZsL5rR6x6Ilg30FbmuaPyBn8Dz0H3-_0s-Aog", "desc": null}, {"title": "Lake Albano", "artist": "Thomas Jones", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8_-JpOR6kiM18SDO_p-jFhW89UhsuAjwt93ygat5b5j_DMm_AkKsGQzcC46oP-WWjTw8hzF8k", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ch\u00e2teau de Pesteil a Polminhac", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Isabey", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_IwzQLpA0oM1DIVGJ3mjuJlZ_aVLIw0bArboLOdJ9Xtv8oSq5X3lz425iLINoAwplpSF38pFA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Judith", "artist": "COROT, Jean-Baptiste Camille", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8CioNtzMZHg7Z4i-hp3UoUOZk-tR4WVFR9_sBMj5UfTc-eGx-V36IXxudXhcrCXKarfAFRl8iL", "desc": null}, {"title": "Charioteer and Horseman", "artist": "Th\u00e9odore Gericault", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8uVDsCEbI9tfC-Oh-URT8knwMwnNDvbf0biRWoZAo7jDBaHNNttiAKroPCcFFsTSbYkXUiPlA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Berglandschap", "artist": null, "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9oyloJ7S6nUGXqd_XJDYmf1vRcaUO4Hdqr4VoDHQhp7AN13D3Iam0e4clLQ6Tcl69d02qwajXP", "desc": null}, {"title": "Guildford", "artist": "Samuel Palmer", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8_5_vUcDJTyrQbuJd0E4FmwnqaGVJ3oQJA8KeKWmoq_TwgniROJhaxqDZX-_U0wkkym-c0f48", "desc": null}, {"title": "Caprichos:  That Certainly is Being Able to Read", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9wfak3Vd2f0AOaIniohGs0oiLAShJJZYZ8EjSaw_vveocFg-jOZpAxMCYPicn7bCGoP_wfM_I", "desc": null}, {"title": "Fontainebleau: The Departure of Napoleon", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8BPp-_J7atmktAQybud7Uk2s30Vcz3ngyrzJkEIq_KpN_Il8i3qiAkI0HmMOVcPSi0fxrWfw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Saint Augustine's Gate, Canterbury", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9fobX9BgfWcZ2Fcaw6i4KJgLg3IwGnrwQZBWLflWa_z77B-OrhpOMnYQ6En9AvEHulFdtK6e4", "desc": null}, {"title": "Las rinde el Sue\u00f1o.

Of a humble and shy nature, he spent his life in poverty, although over time his works were appreciated by artists of much greater prominence, such as C\u00e9zanne and Van Gogh. In particular, the latter declared that his work was, in fact, a continuation of the art of Monticelli. Why did the Arles visionary give such importance to this almost amateur painter of Marseilles? Probably because Monticelli tried to free his brushstroke from any rigid convention. He loved painting portraits and, more frequently, wooded landscapes in which female figures often appear. In addition, he created a series of works that recall eighteenth-century France, using the touch of an extremely delicate and sensitive brush, without being exactly Impressionist. In the painting we see here, it almost seems as though Adolphe is anticipating Symbolism. Indeed, on one hand he had a connection with the so-called School of Barbizon, which favored the forests around Paris; yet on the other hand, he showed a strange mixture of genius and uneasiness which inevitably led him to more advanced destinations. Here are the bodies of young girls, modern nymphs that stand before a background made of trees not exactly in perspective, nevertheless giving the work as a whole a true, intriguing spirit of inspiration. Also beautiful is the figure of uncertain sex that we find in the foreground"}, {"title": "Bach Portrait", "artist": "Engraving", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Sh2KgMlGFbuL35DZLIhbjrHBey_mqA5knhPgs80GleC6CIegPy_qSabCwxBI2YLVZH1A8OA", "desc": "This engraving published by Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel was produced \"after the original painting at St Thomass School in Leipzig\" \u2014 the 1746 portrait by Elias Gottlob Haussmann.

The third tapestry is at the Cathedral Museum and is somewhat different to the cartoon: there is no second seller and no other people around her.

However, while the works of the periods before 1800 \u2013 whether in hymnal joy or admonishing worry \u2013 were concerned with the situation of humanity within the eternal cycle of nature and the will of the Creator, the perspective was reversed at the dawn of modernity: natural cycles became a mirror, an image, of the spirit and disposition of the subject. The literature, philosophy, and aesthetics of the period richly document this development. In the visual arts, Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s first series of seasons marks this shift from the material of the great tradition to a concept of the modern.

It, no doubt, commanded Daguerres attention because of the fidelity with which a crayon or ink sketch could be duplicated on paper. While he failed to distinguish himself as a lithographer, prints like The Entrance to the Church of St.-S\u00e9pulcre do display a remarkable interest in geometry and perspective, as well as in the nuances of how light falls on buildings. Light and geometry would become important to photography two decades later.With lithography one could make and distribute many copies of a drawing relatively inexpensively to a much wider audience. These economic attributes would have been of great interest to Daguerre, who must have grown keenly aware of the importance of developing a group of followers when he opened his diorama in Paris in 1822. Embraced as a new form of entertainment, the diorama created impressive visual illusions in a theatre-like space using life-sized paintings and dramatic lighting effects but no actors. Without walking a step, the audience moved between multiple displays that took them from day to night in a church, for example, or from moments before the eruption of a volcano to the fiery lava flows that came after through the use of a mechanical rotational system.Adapted from Weston Naef, The J. Paul Getty Museum Handbook of the Photographs Collection (Los Angeles: J.

Romanticism. A very solid painter, endowed with a masterly technique, he was unjustly overlooked by twentieth century criticism, and his greatness was only recently rediscovered. Venetian by birth, and thus able to absorb the influences of the eighteenth century lagoon masters, Hayez was also Milanese by adoption, coinciding with the formation of the national identity of the Risorgimento by completing works that represent the realism suffered by many generations of artists. He is particularly effective in portraiture, and in fact we must at least remember the famous painting of Alessandro Manzoni. But his romantic sensibility is combined with an honest and indefatigable attention to the most meticulous details of life. In the work that we admire here, the unknown noblewoman, wrapped in her cap and lace, seems to stand in a conventional position. But the intensity of the face, with the big eyes full of goodness, combined with her complexion and feminine and contrite mouth, gives the character who returns to us from the past a sensitive effectiveness worthy of an excellent painter"}, {"title": "Woodland Landscape near Norwich", "artist": "John Crome", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_0ZtWHIymB8AVmsPXMgCbLXRevSVKhFxBmkVss-niDvRjf_ke4Z_4jSV3_OR9fo9Wr7w2QKJw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Man Foraging (L'homme au fourrage)", "artist": "Alphonse Legros", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-4cPo5ims77PB5U7ElWjyP1NMq_1ZIGUK8BC2V2U0HB_Zi9NsXDFTO4-8X6tHcrxQg4jfGlA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Yarmouth, Norfolk", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8s1e3pngkV_pnDBSTdfDyBmreGjt_ZY3rYkmpMwF3Mn1PrwEfJFpORZJYGOctzCxtVLEThLmPD", "desc": null}, {"title": "Le Cr\u00e9puscule", "artist": "Paul Huet", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_l5FydYG7N2HQBWJ-fEC1pO3eb9bhREi4ScMwVyusaOl3Zz3_56jgk2K-bV8zb0PQS2WSHmOa1", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Study of Prince Karl of Prussia", "artist": "Eduard Gaertner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8KioXkIqFcMaPCuD26Q4ECmLSUZQ9NLx-XVzAMkI6KokTB31W9R12y3ZoUvvA_N281S6HhALg", "desc": "This view of Prince Karl of Prussias study in the Ordnugs-Palais reflects the Mooresque style in the patterned carpet, drapery and cushioned banquettes reflected in the large mirror at the right.

Upon the summit of the highest point of Capri, a monastery was erected long ago to which pilgrims flock every year; the walls of the monastery are still standing and in fair preservation.

When the painting was shown at the Paris Salon in 1763 it was praised by the great French writer on art, Diderot.

In addition to being a national hero due to his military achievements, Espartero became the top political representative of progressive tendencies, in the name of which he took office on several occasions. Although he had to go into exile in London between 1843 and 1848, he was still offered the Regency another time in 1870, which he refused from his retreat in Logro\u00f1o. Casado went there in 1872 to complete this sketch for a portrait of Espartero commissioned by the Congress of Deputies. The portrait was accepted by the Congress on 22 December, while Casado made a gift of the watercolour to Espartero\u2019s wife, Jacinta Mart\u00ednez de Sicilia, Princess of Vergara, as states the inscription \u2018A la Srma.
