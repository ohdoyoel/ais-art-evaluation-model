Clouds have come up and the round shape of the full moon is half hidden behind the banks of cloud at the horizon. This means that the moonlight does not fall evenly but seems to be breaking out of a gateway in the clouds, creating a magical play of light. Complementary colours, ranging from golden to whitish yellow, violet and blue, define the contrasts of light and shade. There is a sense of the magnitude and unity of the universe. Moved by this wonder of nature, three people sit on rounded rocks near the shore, and their dark silhouettes heighten the effect of the gleaming light of the sky and the sea.

"desc": "The Museum of Fine Arts Budapest boasts several masterpieces by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, the leading figure of French Romantic painting. These paintings, drawings and lithographs are representative of all areas of the oeuvre of the artist, who rejected the Classicist cult of the line, and based his own style on the expressive power of colour.Delacroix was celebrated by his contemporaries almost exclusively as a painter, as he was reluctant to part with his drawings, which were not meant either for public display or for collectors. He kept his sketches and studies in his studio, which thus became publicly known only after his death. One of the rare exceptions is one of his most dramatic works, Horse Frightened by Lightning, which soon after completion he gave as a present to a friend, portrait and landscape painter Louis-Auguste Schwiter, in gratitude for the casts of a collection of antique medals, from which Delacroix made lithographs.The horse played a special role in the art of Delacroix in the 1820s. This was so because while preparing the monumental oil painting, Massacre at Chios (1824), he realised he needed a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the horse if he was to paint historical scenes. Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricaults romantically impassioned horse representations were of decisive influence for him, but he did not fail to incorporate in his art the experiences of his 1825 trip to London either. He devoted much time to studying the rearing horses of the Parthenon Marbles in the British Museum, of which he later made lithographs, and he must have been influenced by the work of popular painters of animals. The most immediate precedent of the white rearing horse with the flying mane in the watercolour held in Budapest is to be found in Sawrey Gilpins Horses in a Thunderstorm (1797-1798). Delacroix had to know this work, made for the Royal Academy, because he replicated almost exactly the horse which recoils from the lightning in the middle of the British painting. He transformed this unimportant detail into the main motif, and by meticulously working out the reaction of the animal, he created an emotional charge that makes the piece essentially different from the model. In this watercolour, Delacroix achieves the perfect synthesis of the emotive power of a landscape and that of an animal representation. The plane stretching into the distance and the stormy sky that seems to be its extension provide a background for the frightened, rearing horse, as if for a sculpture. The lighting that crosses the almost unrealistically deep blue sky throws a sharp light on the alarmed animal. The red of its eye and distended nostrils intensifies the panic into a vision. The vehemence of its motion and the gust of the storm ruffle its mane, while its tail is raised in the opposite direction. Delacroixs watercolour embodies all that the horse stood for in the eyes of the Romantics: power, nobility, untamed passion and intensified emotions. Though Alfred Robaut, the first monographer of the artist, dated the piece to 1824, thematic and stylistic links to other dramatic representations make modern scholars believe it was painted later, sometime between 1825 and 1829.Text:"}, {"title": "Boat-Building near Flatford Mill", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8jMqtrzgCIY8NqLkVO4kMzAx5otjlRr0qHbG1-4VhiktPieetKF9HuwHVk4HLzOf7LxGLQXw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Lady Maria Conyngham (died 1843)", "artist": "Sir Thomas Lawrence", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9_0tUrh0R8wk4CneF9SeJmYGsJc9klfJFEJH-6TBGqMzf4U6ltRud-_hkG02PwvLUDw_x4Vw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Meleager and Atalanta", "artist": "Oil on canvas", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM--fl_NiSluIlFtFn6QNkOfh7Dx4N8Ju2DCcRecRhnh4eVJrH27UFO_qouV5sYq9JajFVhdcciB", "desc": "Richard Wilsons subject is taken from the Latin poet Ovids Metamorphoses.

When first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839 with its pendant, Ancient Rome; Agrippina Landing with the Ashes of Germanicus, the painting was accompanied by a modified quotation from Lord Byrons masterpiece, Childe Harolds Pilgrimage (1818): \"The moon is up, and yet it is not night, / The sun as yet divides the day with her.\" Like the poem, Turners painting evokes the enduring sublimity of Rome, which had been for artists throughout history less a place in the real world than one in the imagination.

Held at Palazzo Tursi in Genoa, this sculpture is considered to be an exemplary icon of the Romantic poets. As opposed to the original and the marble version by Canova, the 1833 work sees the painter abandon his usual compositional structure and style, characterized by an elevated sensuality and realism, in order to achieve a more formal and expressive rigor that is academic in nature. The famous portrait artist and painter of scenes from 19th-century Milan outlines a minimalist landscape in the background: the cold, cerulean-clad silhouette of the solitary Mary Magdalene is painted against this backdrop, her hand gently gripping the cross.

Brought close to the viewer as if through a telescope, the summit of the Watzmann seems in its shining, almost glass-like clarity to be in immediate reach, apparently near enough to touch and at the same time distant, like a symbol of divine majesty. In compositional terms the bright mountain grows out of a single, highly variegated motion. Its pyramidal form culminates in the radiant whiteness of ice, a visual concept that Friedrich had already evolved a year previously in his famous painting Sea of Ice: The Wreck of Hope (Hamburger Kunsthalle). Friedrich put The Watzmann on show in 1825 at the Dresden Art Exhibition, probably in reaction to a major work under the same name by Ludwig Richter that was displayed there the year before, based on Josef Anton Koch\u2019s famous Schmadribach Waterfall (Neue Pinakothek, Munich). Friedrich rejected Richter\u2019s narrative approach: landscape painting had been \u201ccloser to its aims than it is at present \u2026 when piled-up objects, one next to the other, one behind the other and one above the other, overburden the picture, and I think are meant to lend opulence,\u201d was one of his statements on art. Friedrich, who never travelled to the Alps, painted The Watzmann on the basis of a watercolor study by his pupil August Heinrich and his own sketches made on journeys through the Harz and Riesengebirge mountains. The motif of the rock formations in the foreground follows a drawing of the Trudenstein at the Hohnekopf near the Brocken mountain done on 28 June 1811. In 1820 Friedrich had already depicted the anvil-like rock on the right in his landscape of the Riesengebirge Landscape with Rising Fog (Neue Pinakothek, Munich). In 1824, a year before The Watzmann, Friedrich showed a view of Montblanc (formerly in the Nationalgalerie, lost in the war) with an almost identical format at the Dresden Academy Exhibition.

They regarded it as a style of nature and the expression of growth striving for freedom. Friedrich\u2019s view of the ruins of Eldena, painted in 1824/25, was preceded by several drawings, including a nature study of 1803 (in the Hamburger Kunsthalle) that the painting largely follows.

Moreover, the arrangement of the fir trees brings to mind Romanticism\u2019s comparison of Gothic architecture and vegetable shapes.

The Water-carrier bears the imprint of both Goyas. At first glance it seems a simple rustic genre picture: a somewhat rough-hewn, yet ethereally charming young girl carries water and food to someone. A forerunner to this figure can be found on tapestry designs twenty years earlier, which Goya made for the Madrid court, at a moment of European optimism, when it seemed that the Enlightenment would bring general welfare. But then all hell was breaking loose and by the time the picture was made Spain had been sacked by Napoleons troops. The idyllic world of the tapestries had gone, and the air is charged with a surly restlessness instead. Indeed, it is war we see here: the water is needed by the nameless heroes of Zaragoza, who held up the invaders practically with their bare hands.

Delacroix had first captured this subject--Chiron, the wisest of all centaurs, training Achilles in the art of hunting--on a corner of a curved ceiling devoted to poetry in Pariss Palais Bourbon Library, which he decorated from 1838 to 1847. On visits to Delacroixs studio twenty years later, Sand admired the new, rectangular painting of the subject the artist was working on. That canvas was promised to another admirer, so Delacroix made this nearly identical pastel for her and wrote to Sands son, Maurice, informing him of the gift.  Highly educated in the classics, Delacroix depicted subjects from antiquity throughout his life.

The name comes from Phaeton, the son of Apollo, who borrowed and crashed his fathers sun-chariot. For a smooth ride, even at speed, the Phaeton had large wheels and huge steel leaf-springs, from which the seat was suspended by means of leather straps, which gave it the nick-name High-Flyer and occasioned numerous satires. In some examples the two axels were the only rigid elements of the design, connected by another steel leaf-spring to allow the vehicle to flex over bumps, like modern independent suspension. Contemporary illustrations suggest that that this fine example of British industrial design was regarded as the pinnacle of fashion and symbol of fast living, women drivers being especially singled out for admiration or opprobrium. When the Prince of Wales over-turned his Phaeton, while driving alone with Mrs Fitzherbert, he presented satirists with an easy target. The Princes carriage here is to be drawn by two magnificently sleek black horses, whose coats and accoutrements match the colours of the carriage and the livery of the groom. The artist explains the harnesses and provides a three-quarter view of the carriage without drawing attention to the technical difficulty of either. This is a scene designed to appeal to the discerning eye of a man of fashion, who in this era would have possessed some expertise in horse-flesh and a more general concern that their mews should be efficiently run and their servants well turned-out. Such things mattered because they reflected on the owner and master. Contemporaries would have recognised in this painting a reflection upon (even a portrait of) the owner of this equipage - the Prince of Wales. We see here a Prince unstuffy enough to drive his own carriage, reducing the trappings of rank to a set of modest silver arms decorating the horses blinkers. The pomp of a Prince is replaced by the elegance of a man of fashion. The quiet dignity of this scene, supported by the Princes portly coachman and methodical assistant, is only disrupted by his Spitz dog, Fino, leaping up at the horse, which starts back in alarm.

At the centre is the Campanile and Basilica of San Marco, the red bricks of the tower emphasizing the unnaturally whitened, almost ghostly domes. To its right is the distinctive upper level of the Doges Palace, which appears somewhat compressed in Turners rendering of it. The building with the attenuated cupola to the right is the Zecca, or Mint. Just above this, two vertical strokes of Turners brush indicate the famous columns of the Lion of San Marco and San Theodore, standing in the Piazzetta. From there the paved Riva degli Schiavoni stretches into the distance, fringed by countless boats. Off to the right, fireworks explode above the larger vessels moored in the harbour alongside Palladios church of San Giorgio Maggiore. In the square, a mass of revellers are dressed for carnival, their attention divided between musicians, puppet shows and the burst of fireworks alongside Florians caf\u00e9. This work is a nocturnal scene where fire erupts into the darkness, captivating the onlookers. Some scholars have speculated that Turner exploited these effects to play on the well-established comparison between the formerly great Venice, then subject to Austrian law, and contemporary London. The title of the picture, however, invoked Shakespeares play Romeo and Juliet, the festive Piazza presumably standing in for the Capulets ball. The young John Ruskin (1819-1900), later an influential writer on art and society, was among those who have taken up the challenge of defending Turners iconography and his alleged topographical infelicities in the depiction of Venice. But, ultimately, the picture needs no apologist, for it is one of the most appealingly atmospheric canvases of the second half of Turners career: its powerful combination of dynamic perspective and punctuating bursts of light is readily apparent"}, {"title": "Flatford Lock", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Hgb8sFdNVdZuYH7USIkRanqav0XaxzQeVmHOgHXOYBuzdrjhhwWw0ljI7_S1lUv7jviMGtg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ira Aldridge in the Role of Shakespeare's Othello", "artist": "William Mulready", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8wj10VOcswRu-k3XCDw_bJn-wagCiCPTr2KPHDw-mh1MHULl4RYTcVjaP3D8Cs018DjzOf", "desc": "The subject of this work shows a marked resemblance to the famous African-American actor Ira Aldridge (1807-1867), praised as one of the greatest tragic actors of his day, he won renown in Europe for his Shakespearean roles, including Lear, Macbeth and, most famously, Othello. On October 10, 1825, Aldridge made his European debut, making him the first African American actor to establish himself professionally in a foreign country (at Londons Royal Coburg Theatre). The following year he played Othello. By the time of his death in 1867 he had won awards and medals all over Europe, having played in Berlin, Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Cologne, Bonn, Budapest and the major cities of Russia. An innovation Aldridge introduced early in his career was a direct address to the audience on the closing night of his engagement at a given theatre.

Written in the early fourteenth century, this epic poem recounts Dante\u2019s imaginary pilgrimage through Hell and Purgatory to Paradise. Commissioned by his last patron, John Linnell, Blake produced 102 drawings illustrating the Divine Comedy between 1824 and his death in 1827. These drawings range from preliminary sketches to highly finished watercolours. Only seven of the compositions were engraved for Linnell\u2019s proposed publication. Blake\u2019s personal theology led him not only to illustrate but to comment upon, and even criticize, Dante\u2019s Catholic interpretation of salvation, stating that \u2018Dante saw Devils where I see none \u2013 I see only good\u2019. In Paradise Dante, guided by his beloved Beatrice, meets St Peter and St James who are illuminated by the brilliant flames of redemption. The ethereal world is radiantly evoked by the translucent rainbow hues, while the figures are clearly influenced by the art of Michelangelo, just as others in the series pay tribute to D\u00fcrer"}, {"title": "A Horse Affrighted at a Lion", "artist": "George Stubbs", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-oO6o1qHZ4WsTT7Rlr2RBR1hF6An3qHth51ErTL0Tsm1bsr9eRu5sB-HuvSuxK59sPQDq1Bcg", "desc": null}, {"title": "Forest Interior by Moonlight", "artist": "Caspar David Friedrich", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8Y1Xrkm6WTLpfC__sP0zLVZna3vT686CGsF-K7ODFkYFrEwp210_ksgOicwmnqcdAcEmzdC48", "desc": "Whereas Italy was regarded as the land for which all artists yearned in the 18th and 19th centuries, Caspar David Friedrich felt drawn to the landscapes of northern Europe. He made several journeys to the Baltic Sea, to the mountains of Saxony and Bohemia; many of his coast, mountain and forest landscapes testify to this. The wonderfully radiant blue of the night sky is the dominant tone in this painting. A white full moon behind a tracery of pines lights up the cleared slopes of a forest ravine. The moonlight that illuminates the forest does not, however, seem to reach the shadowy foreground. Here, between mounds of earth and the stumps of trees, a man and a woman have taken refuge in a cave and lit a warming fire, over which they are preparing a meal. The mood of mystery of the nocturnal forest landscape suggests a religious interpretation. According to this, the hills in the foreground and the fire in the cave refer to the pains and transitory nature of earthly existence. The finely articulated pine forest behind them, by contrast, possesses an almost immaterial quality; by comparison with the scene in the foreground it appears to be a realm beyond and remote from the world and comes to a climax in the blue night sky. Friedrich juxtaposes the labours of life on the earth with the beauty and solace of a moonlit night. This work, once owned by the Berlin publisher Georg Andreas Reimer, was unknown to researchers until 1992, when it reappeared on the art market and was acquired for the Nationalgalerie"}, {"title": "Job's Evil Dreams", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_A7a8K4L0wkRge7bDpwpT8VXgH70DROAumjQb7gK2TW8x29B0yzM0l7_R3f01wI9Z8wFjbnQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Fall of the Accuser", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_E_UE_HT-d_zOXyrg85IvWIO3WzqvsfJFtnX1t63xqI6cw8dpw1bSQ3ivXe3dlpIbDSrNriLk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Three men digging; folio 51 from the Images of Spain Album 'F'", "artist": "Francisco de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-H-dlHEngCDAnbgB3o9ejTrOaoc7Yo4_N5WrIhfLRGY0hYxLlFDJwnHXLegbnhptvkAOCVoDI", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Seven Ages of Man: The Lover, 'As You Like It,' II, vii", "artist": "chairs", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9je3XGh63gtTLWcCe1xKMnpjJKdbflBtsS4x-SYsrEWf-z_z3OwdZATnvbwihaYP3ZQD9XWaCf", "desc": null}, {"title": "La casa de locos", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_yssr9YNl_5UENkkeGXmftYCL6Gm4qAPV0-9eHwDMW4ON8XteQIRgKIs0cqcfaIqfW8qkzsWQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "It's Raining Elves (\"Llueven duendes\")", "artist": "Leonardo Alenza y Nieto", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8BJUzNxEgVn5FmboKD_FijCvysVXgntldnPeelOC6JIgz8BhOCfTzcAK-n8hVc_iQ7i-9-M2c", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Woman with Gambling Mania, 1820", "artist": "Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_sECi93SsGB1I0IQNF0mAWjAH2LAloRRkITZ-q7IOZn8yH3Nc81bh9j405yndFBRkHV7ZxebY", "desc": null}, {"title": "Disparate pobre", "artist": "Francisco Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-lu-Zg9GZGXcCYDUBIFoP5g6BzmyDIfQqNSG78UbpVhRTF-QXosYBZQJGdHiuuUSMAwj6bTFo", "desc": null}, {"title": "Thou who cannot", "artist": "Francisco Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9cAbgSxhMki-OVczt4dIB7aVnWUZf9N0QhgvGda_d3kNZl3nUHCznMUlNVd2MPdWFxuzdmjQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Caernarvon Castle", "artist": "Joseph Farington", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-PfOJCqIXy1sr6NitH4WDHtwrc3gv71fc43n166u5WbiDcwwkVzA21sZ5g5VoiOiLI55Kh2QmZ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Behemoth and Leviathan", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_kDZWbLjnA86trg4LGWgX7oOJYsKwWVFQEiJyBjAI9NhMwjVYcmlKZ5JXyHXpvYypUNrPKXuM", "desc": null}, {"title": "Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM90cppcYd8NSx44CJdjEY7L_1KNbhVEdNJfxrB4SEuMdfA1uCE9kTKXnfitGMGPfwY5jrREEw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Satan Smiting Job with Boils, from Illustrations of the Book of Job", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_SPHL8cfaKQ_sp3OBl6eofI3uXkAsjh3IP1evAr9oVpqa9IkhVS0rcl9Y0c9HCmvb3aMw9WRM", "desc": null}, {"title": "Pauline Runge with her two-year-old-son", "artist": "Philipp Otto Runge", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_4_g9pNMhfY3lGQ01uUXZ-U8448e0LXjqbe4rmH0bWY0qIGNZhS_1zwWl0nLeNkH6_vvMQFgk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Abbey St-Amand, Rouen", "artist": "Richard Parkes Bonington", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_FehbzuHAv7wWM1nYH-yHxl063EfAx1EUeJFZlGycZEGE6bTIPRUQhiQZQbAagM_xyO3xrgHE", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Meeting of Orestes and Hermione", "artist": "Anne-Louis Girodet de Roucy", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-I3b-75xaFT_K6lDGQK0DqhyxyxlxifN7knIFTB3s-g1xkFo-hYEfwHSvDfoEmfu9hBqhWhYk", "desc": "When the French painter Jacques-Louis David was approached to work on a new edition of Jean Racine\u2019s plays, he passed the task to his pupil Girodet, who excelled at illustrating literature.

The canvas, which was the property of Litta Modignani in 1934, reappeared on the antique market in the 1990s when it was purchased by Cariplo. The episode of Peter the Hermit preaching in the square of Clermont, in the presence of Urban II is inspired by Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Michaud\u2019s Histoire des croisades, translated into Italian in 1826. After the Council held in Clermont in November 1095, the pope launched his famous appeal inviting Christian knights to intervene in defence of the Church, and to aid their Eastern brothers in the Holy Land. In his faithful pictorial transposition of the literary text Hayez arranges the scene around the tall throne erected for the pope in the square packed with a huge crowd, and focuses on the main events: Peter the Hermit\u2019s preaching and the distribution of red cloth crosses destined to be worn by those who engaged to do battle. This canvas once again displays the artist\u2019s indisputable skill in rendering the garments and setting within the precise reconstruction of an episode drawn from medieval history, and above all it reveals the potential of history painting to express the feelings and reactions of a crowd. Powerful dramatic and emotional moments alternate with moving elegiac scenes of farewell, like that of the couple kissing in the foreground or the woman left alone with her baby, an obvious allusion to the father\u2019s departure. When it appeared in 1835 it had a mixed reception from the critics: some said the composition was disorganized in its orchestration of the numerous different groups and the handling was too hasty especially as regards the crowd in the distance, but most praised the freshness of the execution and the rich variety of expression. Hayez also painted other works on the theme of the Crusades, full of political allusions to the contemporary Italian situation and the need for national liberation: the famous Peter the Hermit, 1829 (private collection), a real appeal to the cause of independence, and Thirst for the Crusades (Turin, Palazzo Reale)"}, {"title": "Hamlet and Guildenstern (Act III, Scene II)", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9p9bxfiPs3XipJrXyqJIpmRlIlfgEw6tt9yF7EZwfYmy9GSpf0xKMKq990RWwd63Ok6Puidw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Fifth Plague of Egypt", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-P2l04xNCE6vB2ecVWbMhkdpBUUOVujrxCRwvjvuVaHtgRR2rm7bdD-EQRUVCzZDjbbNAVkhLI", "desc": null}, {"title": "African Beach", "artist": "Drawing", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8m3ZHaFSZHGvftKQ7teq9QAbpCOMTmHlG4x5Q8SeIRRC-DBK38Dy2TwV3c-7WmEkLTO-7-kQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Ulysses at the Court of Alcinous", "artist": "Francesco Hayez", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8fO2e2qprf0TMeZSHShkd2vYpRnWGNFU6ukCa6V0tgIln783Qeb6Fg7aeRsAEJmd5dX8tlRM0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Allegory of Love, Cupid and Psyche [?]", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_OIrYlFLjsd2cMT1oKz4Rasvy_maLjXug8UNGdISX-ewBZCp6651lMqMr3e2TY3_vM-RWM", "desc": "The scene is associated with the story of Cupid and Psyche, immortalised in the Metamorphoses by Lucius Apuleius, in which the god of sexual attraction falls in love with Psyche and visits her at night always to conceal his identity.

The artist represents the moment when, on September 5 and 6, 1838, the Temeraire was towed, from the Thames estuary (from Sheerness) to its place of demolition (at Rotherhithe), by a steam tug. The dark and heavy form of the latter is brought to life as an innovative driving force, as evidenced by the tall smoking chimney and the two paddle wheels. It contrasts with the noble whitish silhouette of the Temeraire, which seems to glide, like a phantom vessel on the waves, towards its ultimate end. Turner accentuates the dramatic destiny of the warship by placing the scene at the end of the day, in the setting sun. The moon is also present, at the top left; its light is reflected in the calm waters. The sky inflamed with yellow, orange, red and mauve floods the surface of the painting, creating a vaporous and dramatic atmosphere, attenuated by the blue of the horizon.The painter took liberties in describing the event and the boats. At the time of the events, the Temeraire was disarmed and without rigging, but Turner added these; it was pulled by two tugs, Turner shows only one and he reverses the position of his chimney and his mast on which flies a white flag. Turner did not want to represent the reality of the scene which he may not have seen. He wanted to convey an emotion and transform the event into a metaphor. It symbolizes a turning point in the history of navigation and its development towards modernity: the end of the majestic sailing ships and their gradual replacement by steamships , the future of the navy"}, {"title": "A Stalk of Lilies with Six Blooms", "artist": "Philipp Otto Runge", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8GCiOO4a12k9hFEAzg288G8sKQuS7HMreQo18mhA4So29H-YDc0rhQdIwOm_lPJk_BPrXzHQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Landscape with Gypsies and Wagon", "artist": "David Cox", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9XVdPADJOZpgWjKljYMCiU1-72HurQlei50j5SsmTyEqzC1HV-VHVbh7UxOlt9UiXU8Xf1M1o", "desc": null}, {"title": "Fantasia Arabe", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne\u00a0Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_LyQzZP79bmUwwh7S3pDoT13PWyKpNjDiMGypNs92UVM8-CnTOqgQSey04WjijVbCRR196dJQ", "desc": null}, {"title": "Still Life with Flowers, Shells, a Shark's Head, and Petrifications", "artist": " Philadelphia Museum of Art", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-KDSmsniEkbMyzlxmoKXIqP6WhtFeVfa_QLWvGg9Z3ZtgAfQ8gnFGRyujrIt3CN1FJ9V4i3kk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Fool`s Folly", "artist": "Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_C3pESiTX0yZ1oPMLwn2S1ecIh-GibFeo0bwznImd0J48Gimy0CqRmXyOGXD9wMbtZLZs64A", "desc": null}, {"title": "Brighton Beach", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8ZRfQUkPDw3NiieJcffxRlTybGHI670-cEXfoQj4eL0Tt3Dy-1SripzYs94FqMkdHbG_ba1uI", "desc": null}, {"title": "St. S\u00e9verin, Paris", "artist": "Thomas Shotter Boys", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9Ih3XP5fyg3HXk6yoMNuJm8ALePesaUsEx9tzhTZf2Cx-yLQVO4RicbILPOHojyV5SDEibDw", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Library in the Apartment of Count Lanckoronski in Vienna, Riemergasse 8", "artist": "Rudolf von  Alt", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8IMdgJWLACiS_7V-9ZgM8QLtQ-NbCMdLh0HoU1FYDgzC8InIcfNThkW6Yy1pM5PwF6hn6oo506", "desc": "The library of Count Lanckoronski reveals the scholarly interests of a wealthy nobleman.

Born to an artisan in provincial Baden in the early nineteenth century, he soon became widely renowned for his portraits of European royalty and aristocrats. He was known as the painter of princes and travelled tirelessly to courts in France, Belgium, Great Britain, Austria, Spain and Portugal in pursuit of commissions, which he and his younger brother Hermann then executed in their Paris studio. In 1870 the Winterhalter brothers returned to their native Baden, having run a flourishing business in the French capital since 1834. While Franz visited the clients and did portrait drawings of their subjects, Hermann ran the studio and was in charge of the apprentices. Although Hermann did produce paintings of his own, he was frequently occupied making copies of highly sought-after compositions by his brother. In the end Hermann became so adept at imitating Franzs style that to this day it is barely possible to definitively identify work as that of either one or the other"}, {"title": "Plate 46 from ' Los Caprichos': Correction (Correccion.)", "artist": "Francisco de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8BwsfciZl8GkhV1Cugh_6WRI9jE6QtPmu7iVKhVMYe4pE71MvgfOkJ3pca6kGX31w6o46x6joS", "desc": null}, {"title": "New Rome.

Fuseli selected his themes from literature, but his idiosyncratic interpretation can make it difficult to identify exact subjects. The curtain creates the stagelike effect, which, along with the linear, abstract representation of monumental figures, recall Fuselis Shakespearean drawings of the early 1770s, made during his years in Italy.

The Huesca Museum piece was painted in 1880 and is an example of history painting, which was very popular in the 19th century.

Above all, the depiction of the ruins of Gothic churches, with nature rapidly reclaiming them, visualized the tension between decay and the emergence of the new. Blechen intensifies the refined subdivisions of the masses and the light-suffused Gothic religious edifice in his watercolour: The fragments of the ribbed vaults and pointed arches are filled with brightness and the luminescent colours of the surrounding nature. Unlike C. D. Friedrich\u2019s landscapes with ruins dating from the same period, Blechen\u2019s pieces are not intended to leave us contemplatively pondering religion. Blechen\u2019s fictitious scenes are defined by a stage-setlike composition and staging.

This work reflects the artists sense of tragedy as he suffered from illness and the deaths of his friends. The works deep religiosity relates to the character of his revered Rembrandt. According to Ren\u00e9 Huyghe, the motif of steps moving from above ground to below ground appears in several works by Rembrandt, and the S-shaped form provides the work with appropriate compositional movement.\tBaudelaire made the following comment regarding this painting in his critique of the 1859 Salon, \"There is no finer expression of this theme than Christ Carried Down to the Tomb (originally referred to as The Entombment of Christ). It would take a Titian to create such a work. He would use a different method in the creation of his composition but, yes this is true.

Jahrhunderts, so formte sich auch im biedermeierlichen Wien die Blumenmalerei zu einer eigenst\u00e4ndigen Gattung aus, die in Europa einzigartig ist. Sie setzte eine Tradition fort, die der Maler Johann Baptist Drechsler Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts \u00fcber die Kunstschule der Wiener Porzellanmanufaktur begr\u00fcndet hatte.Von Jugend an, besonders aber seit den sp\u00e4ten zwanziger Jahren arbeitete auch Waldm\u00fcller auf diesem Gebiet, in das er schon als Kind eingef\u00fchrt worden war. So unterschiedliche Stoffgebiete er auch ber\u00fchrte, stets entstanden Werkgruppen, Varianten eines Typus, so in der Portr\u00e4t-, in der Landschafts-, in der Genre- und in der Stillebenmalerei. Weit davon entfernt, Gegenst\u00e4nde des Alltags durch die Malkunst adeln zu wollen (vgl. die Blumenstilleben von Thoma, Manet, C\u00e9zanne), w\u00e4hlte Waldm\u00fcller ausschlie\u00dflich Kostbarstes: empfindliche Blumenz\u00fcchtungen, Silber, Edelsteinschmuck und Antikes (der rotfigurige Glockenkrater mit dionysischer Darstellung ist im Kunsthistorischen Museum in Wien erhalten), das er auf buntem Marmor vor einem Gobelin (in dem man ein Rubens-Vorbild erkannt hat) arrangiert. Stilleben sind stets Abbreviaturen f\u00fcr eine Welt. Dieses ist nicht ein Konzentrat von \u203aNatur\u2039, \u203aParadies\u2039 oder \u203aHaus\u2039, sondern eindeutig von \u203aSalon\u2039. Eine aristokratische Lebenssph\u00e4re von h\u00f6chster Kostbarkeit und K\u00fcnstlichkeit gibt sich zu erkennen, und mit diesen bis ins letzte scharf ausformulierten Formen, mit diesen differenzierten Oberfl\u00e4chenbeschaffenheiten und Lichtstufungen bekennt sich die Malkunst zu einer verfeinerten Handwerklichkeit, die alle Virtuosit\u00e4t hinter sich gelassen hat.

The painting\u2019s three vanishing points make the forest interior look like the nave and two aisles of a basilica. Only a few individual rays of light penetrate the cathedral-like vault of dense foliage and scatter restlessly among the deep shadows of the forest.

She is shown au naturel, on foot and framed by the landscape, in a manner that greatly appealed to local tastes. There is no opposition between the sophisticated style of the portrait and the model\u2019s informal pose and captivating sense of freshness. On the contrary, the piece retains the spontaneity that characterises the painter\u2019s best work in the genre.Although the painting bears some similarities to other representations of women made by the artist in the same period, it stands out for its unrivalled refinement.

In 1817, he traveled to Rome where he witnessed the annual Carnival horse race and subsequently made numerous studies of this spectacle. This study marks the moment just before the race begins, when the terrified riderless horses begin their run down the Corso in Rome.A groom tries to contain a rearing horse in the center, while other men all around push and pull the wild animals, goading them into a frenzied stampede.

Reproduced in engravings and described in detail in the press, the work shows the same handling of light and perspective as the previous versions but differs in terms of the episodes depicted and its larger size. The illusionistic effect of placing the viewer in the main doorway of Milan Cathedral between the two rows of pillars in the nave is obtained by combining a solid perspective grid with a calibrated play of light, entering from the windows on the right and striking the pillars and the floor, while the darkness of the vaulted ceiling is pierced by a single shaft from the window in the upper storey. In the background, the high altar, where Mass is being celebrated, is festively adorned and illuminated by numerous candles creating a virtuoso light effect. Reports of the period praised the work for the great realism and variety of the social types portrayed, focusing in particular on the minor episode of a sumptuously dressed young woman in the group of  figures in the light in the nave. She is turning her head to the right in search of an elegant young man at the far end of the church, who returns her gaze. Migliara continued to feature this subject in numerous works until the 1830s, some of which were commissioned by members of the aristocracy and the upper middle classes, including the viceroy Archduke Ranieri, the Melzi d\u2019Eril family and Countess Giulia Samoyloff. From the miniature on silk to the large canvas, adopting the same perspective viewpoint with slight variations as regards the lighting and the episodes depicted, this ultimately became a classic view of the cathedral interior. The model was taken up by the \u201cMigliaristi\u201d Giovanni Battista dell\u2019Acqua and Pompeo Calvi, who were followed in the second half of the century by Filippo Carcano and Arturo Ferrrari"}, {"title": "Plate 5 from 'The Disasters of War' (Los Desastres de la Guerra): 'And they are like wild beasts.'

Its building began in August 1845, and the bridge was inaugurated in April 1847, but on 28 September 1852, as a result of a flood, it collapsed taking the people who were crossing with it. As a result, the painting became a splendid and unique testimony of this early piece of engineering"}, {"title": "A Churchyard with Ruined Tower Among Trees on Rising Ground", "artist": "Thomas Gainsborough", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM885_zgmo9ieXRUbr9-P-OTy1Q8qfzvasYCkeJe8ouGUHa5qeNNpXiKNtO-Wm-tDNkWAZJZ", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Horrors of War:  It Always Happens", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_iSsDvJmPaEdbedgmYnafD4qHygef6WWxWnEpxBIrtV8o4uzv1s2pmOSTASB6g15q9e_FXc1w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Caprichos:  Nothing Could Be Done About It", "artist": "Francisco de Goya", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_ik3HUeWOjXjchfAnZz5sg5-kkCYY5wq1jfsUzRqoqczKxfNoPwVdppoAi19VLh-3MnyquFw", "desc": null}, {"title": "Derbyshire Landscape", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-FOdEBdG6tUTV4pM-0bL7xlcMidxrh5ZjdcyonlUbUyG5tFwUL50-GfVDJ26F-VWPIjUpM7w", "desc": null}, {"title": "Labourers", "artist": "George Stubbs", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8m5VJiDh_MxlY3FHoBrMQ7Wx5Fp-r7iTPXorYLjpUkqdnDkWZFir-AFyb1zu9Fn3_rRgvStA", "desc": null}, {"title": "Satan Before the Throne of God, from Illustrations of the Book of Job", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_smgS2NGLRCwXweWQmjCDCeMFonFcuoaIOalw2DX1MpqyP7EEHXHCT_quUpI0P4ZEQHdduEzI", "desc": null}, {"title": "Lion and Serpent (Lion au Serpent)", "artist": "Antoine-Louis Barye", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8EC99GTcTWeb1kkvJ5AWZR6wZamKJcE_LawTBvBxtYUzg7cxzXzCelF8hnCO407ONoEiMJ8w-j", "desc": null}, {"title": "Thenot Remonstrates With Colinet, from Thornton's Pastorals of Virgil", "artist": "William Blake", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-cgw4BBZOnb-giErtxxiHdIB7NR9SIgW8t88y99VwQqp8ZlZQwbI8YwcMVDG98s4Otc3JOhm0", "desc": null}, {"title": "Rue du gros-horloge, Rouen", "artist": "Richard Parkes Bonington", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8QUb5-dRmHPGNhC9C3Y2muRuFgmxKwHDToUlk2J0mBGbvKUsoxTL4XgRAqrpAlxOwTh0rh1g", "desc": null}, {"title": "View Along the Norman Coast", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Isabey", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9px-K2GJ75_KHcVk45PGjLAXIoyp3YEGAKzEN4IPz7l80cBKucLhsmerT_-NpOccKa4zQCpMs", "desc": null}, {"title": "Faust and Mephistopheles in the Hartz Mountains (Goethe, Faust)", "artist": "Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9X0Yf9dBWwsZwe6v6yGUYiRe3LTzjLLwyd9_h7VdnUl8OK0zWGliAyOPucmwQ88iQbClzR", "desc": null}, {"title": "What a tailor can do!", "artist": "Francisco Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9K__xCjSYP0VHMDBjMdLmHcHowlqujuJ4j_bSEfMpVNhOf3Tk9UWa_THz-Zjc4YPScbvqIah4", "desc": null}, {"title": "Fulham Church from across the River", "artist": "John Constable", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-SSidoWETE1NfwNyNFGja-VU-8kjklLOokw8zCEctSKE_gUZNq3KQMTSvO0GSeDSAE6fHcd2A", "desc": null}, {"title": "The Fish Market at Hastings Beach", "artist": "Joseph Mallord William Turner", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM8wTnIvv20S_JI7v__XVCqcESM25D4mvPoT3sspGEvd3c-yQsdJr2TX-FJfgKZhvOPR34Xq-DPO", "desc": "J.

Long believed to have been lost, it was presented for the first time to the general public in 1983 at the anthological exhibition of work by Francesco Hayez at the Palazzo Reale in Milan. On that important occasion, which marked the start of critical reappraisal of the artist\u2019s work and key role in the romantic movement, it was identified as a section of the huge canvas The Death of Abradates, painted in the spring of 1813 during the artist\u2019s stay in Rome for the first-class competition of the Brera Academy. In his memoirs Hayez outlines the events connected with the painting\u2019s complex gestation, which involved two of the leading figures in the world of art at the time, both of whom played a crucial role in the moulding of the young artist, namely the sculptor Antonio Canova and Count Leopoldo Cicognara, then president of the Venice Academy of Fine Arts. It was in fact Cicognara that urged Hayez to take part in the annual competition of the Brera Academy early in 1813 through a letter addressed to their mutual friend Antonio Canova. This was prompted by the unsatisfactory results obtained by the painter the previous year, when his huge canvas Laocoon (Milan, Accademia di Brera) was awarded the joint first prize together with a work by Antonio De Antoni, the pupil of Andrea Appiani, premier peintre to the Emperor Napoleon and an authoritative member of the Milanese Academy. The decision was dictated by considerations of internal politics and deeply offended both the young artist, who was well aware of the marked superiority of his work, and above all his Venetian protector, who urged him to compete again in 1813, confident of an overwhelming victory this time. After a initial attempt to avoid this challenge and above all the risk of fresh disappointment, the painter yielded to Cicognara\u2019s persuasion and addressed the set subject in a canvas of monumental proportions. Having completed the heads of the main group, however, he staged an accident so that a large easel fell on the painting and damaged it irreparably. The set subject of the competition that year, namely the death of Abradates, is taken from a passage in the Cyropaedia of Xenophon (VI, 3 and VII, 3) that relates the grief shown by Cyrus, the all-powerful king of the Persians, on the death of Abradates, initially his enemy and later his ally in the war against Croesus. It thus lent itself to glorification of the moral qualities of the Persian monarch and hence by association those of Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of the French. For this exemplary work of history painting, still bound by the dictates of the neoclassical school, Hayez combined the ancient text with elements drawn from his reading of the popular contemporary novel Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Gr\u00e8ce by the Jesuit Jean Jacques Barthelemy (1793). The surviving section of the work shows the group of figures led by Cyrus, who indicates the funeral gifts with a wave of his hand while gazing upon the now lost main group of Queen Panthea embracing the corpse of her husband Abradates. The figure in the truncated conical hat looking in the opposite direction to the main event can be identified as the painter Tommaso Minardi, recalled by Hayez in his memoirs as ironic and insincere. This intense and realistic portrait of the future founder of the Purist movement provides significant evidence of the two artists\u2019 relationship and period of training together in Rome before they went their separate ways"}, {"title": "Moonlight", "artist": " http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/697/Moonlight", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM_-ndffW3Wp5EJm1gCGeTks6_WsAjKJUL2blR3p4D1wsUHbchLUmmxOP6HyCiwX3kP_UfdAnYk", "desc": null}, {"title": "Die soldaat!", "artist": "Goya, Francisco", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM-A6zUByqR-Mge5wePoilaZvd4Mc4zmzBpBSBpY9EquxBcEKdJqn1e6nWtzfaOr-VMRKq_EKkU", "desc": null}, {"title": "A Picador Caught by a Bull", "artist": "Francisco de Goya y Lucientes", "img_url": "//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ci/AC_FhM9wKEBOwRvCyzgO660Tb-h29Z1ykxzEuEaaEacGs105F-yQ1Fs9kmiMBAGa113UvIx1YrQYt7NI", "desc": "This 1825 print by Francisco de Goya is part of The Bulls of Bordeaux, a series of four lithographs: Spanish Entertainment; The Famous American, Mariano Ceballos; A Picador Caught by a Bull; and Bullfight in a Divided Ring.

On loan from the Ch\u00e2teau de Flers museum in 2000 for a retrospective on the painter, the artwork was then, most spectacularly, reattributed to Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791\u20131824). Bruno Chenique and Sylvain Laveissi\u00e8re, who researched the comparison, found a series of convincing matches with confirmed paintings by the great master. According to their analysis, the artwork has the characteristics of a G\u00e9ricault in terms of framing and the rendering of skin and clothes. To support his hypothesis, Bruno Chenique made painstaking comparisons with the mane of the Head of a White Horse by G\u00e9ricault, with the eyes of the Portrait of a Kleptomaniac and with the skin of the Severed Heads, strange still-life studies the artist used as documentary material for The Raft of the Medusa. Nevertheless, not all experts agree on the attribution to G\u00e9ricault, which remains the subject of passionate debate. The painting still holds secrets, and some points, such as its dating and its aim, remain to be clarified.The subject of the painting suggests that the artwork was completed in Rome, where Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault resided in 1816 and 1817. The model, an elderly woman, her skin leathered from the sun, is portrayed in several paintings by artists who stayed at the Villa Medici in the 1820s. L\u00e9on Cogniet shows her in a pose similar to that of G\u00e9ricault, Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Navez places her in a Scene of Brigands as a fortune teller, and Jean-Victor Schnetz depicts her in the same way in two of his paintings, with The Fortune Teller, c. 1820, and A Gypsy Predicting the Future of Sixte-Quint, in 1826, of which he produced six different versions. The residents at the French Academy in Rome and the artists who revolved around the institution formed a tight circle.
