The goddess is standing on a giant scallop shell, as pure and as perfect as a pearl. She is met by a young woman, who is sometimes identified as one of the Graces or as the Hora of spring, and who holds out a cloak covered in flowers. Even the roses, blown in by the wind are a reminder of spring. The subject of the painting, which celebrates Venus as symbol of love and beauty, was perhaps suggested by the poet Agnolo Poliziano. It is highly probable that the work was commissioned by a member of the Medici family, although there is nothing written about the painting before 1550, when Giorgio Vasari describes it in the Medici\u2019s Villa of Castello, owned by the cadet branch of the Medici family since the mid-15th century. This hypothesis would seem to be born out by the orange trees in the painting, which are considered an emblem of the Medici dynasty, on account of the assonance between the family name and the name of the orange tree, which at the time was \u2018mala medica\u2019. Unlike the \u201cAllegory of Spring\u201d, which is painted on wood, the \u201cBirth of Venus\u201d was painted on canvas, a support that was widely used throughout the 15th century for decorative works destined to noble houses. Botticelli takes his inspiration from classical statues for Venus\u2019 modest pose, as she covers her nakedness with long, blond hair, which has reflections of light from the fact that it has been gilded; even the Winds, the pair flying in one another\u2019s embrace, is based on an ancient work, a gem from the Hellenistic period, owned by Lorenzo the Magnificent."}, {"title": "Holy Family, known as the \u201cDoni Tondo\u201d", "artist": "Michelangelo Buonarroti", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1506337144913089-Michelangelo-tondo-doni-principale.png?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Michelangelo painted this Holy Family for a Florentine merchant, Agnolo Doni, whose prestigious marriage to Maddalena Strozzi in 1504 took place in a period that was crucial for early 16th-century Florentine art. The presence in the city of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael together, boosted the already lively Florentine art scene, which in the first decade of the century experienced a period of great cultural fervour. Agnolo was thus able to celebrate his marriage and the birth of his first child with some of the highest expressions of this exceptional artistic period: a portrait of husband and wife painted by Raphael and the \u2018tondo\u2019 by Michelangelo, which is the only finished panel painting by the artist to survive. Michelangelo had not long studied the potential of the circular shape, which was greatly appreciated in the early Renaissance for religious decorations for the home, in the marble of the \u201cPitti Tondo\u201d (Bargello National Museum) and the \u201cTaddei Tondo\u201d (Royal Academy of London): in both cases, the Virgin, Child and Infant St John powerfully occupy the whole surface of the relief. The \u201cDoni Tondo\u201d is also conceived as if it were a sculpture, in which the pyramidal composition of the group takes up almost the entire height and width of the panel. It has been noted that the compactness of the group is like the structure of a dome, albeit one that is animated on the inside by the twisting bodies and the concatenation of gestures as the Christ Child is gently passed from the hands of St Joseph to those of Mary. This composition, which is so articulated and expressive, comes from Michelangelo\u2019s own knowledge and study of the great marble sculptures from the Hellenic Period (III-I century B. C.), with their outstanding coiled movements and high degree of expression, which were emerging from excavations of Roman villas. Some of these important finds, such as the Apollo of the Belvedere and the Laoco\u00f6n excavated in January 1506, are promptly referred to in the painting, among the naked figures leaning against a balustrade (to the left and right of St Joseph). The presence of Laoco\u00f6n made it possible to date the tondo to a period coinciding with the birth of Maria Doni (September 1507). The young nudes, whose identification is complex, seem to represent pagan humanity, separated from the Holy Family by a short wall that represents original sin, past which there is also an Infant St John, which would seem to refer to the interpretation of the painting as being for a christening. The frame around the painting, probably designed by Michelangelo, was carved by Francesco del Tasso, an exponent of the highest level of the tradition of wood carving in Florence. It shows the head of Christ and those of four prophets, surrounded by grotesques  and racemes, in which there are half moons, hidden in the top left section: the emblem of the Strozzi family."}, {"title": "Supper at Emmaus", "artist": "Jacopo Carucci, known as Pontormo", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1588264711238128-6b.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Jacopo Carucci, known as Pontormo, after his birth town, trained in Florence in the workshops of Piero di Cosimo and Mariotto Albertinelli, before eventually joining that of Andrea del Sarto, where he worked alongside Rosso Fiorentino. From his early works, influenced by the master\u2019s moderate classicism and his deep reflection on the models of Michelangelo, the artist developed a vibrant, restless style, based on a new psychological and compositional tension, and an incisiveness of northern descent, derived in particular from the prints of D\u00fcrer. These characteristics would be developed in his later works, and effectively exacerbated in the final part of Pontormo\u2019s artistic career, which personifies the most tormented phase of Mannerism. In 1523, Jacopo took shelter in the Galluzzo Charterhouse to flee from the plague that was raging through Florence. There, he set to work painting the cycle of frescoes with the Stories of the Passion on the lunette windows of the main cloister. Once he had completed the cycle, the monks of the charterhouse commissioned him to paint this large panel for the guest quarters. The painting depicts the apparition of Christ to the Apostles as related in the Gospel of Luke (24:13-35). After his resurrection, Jesus, dressed as a traveller, met two of his disciples along the road that led to Emmaus, a small village near Jerusalem, but they failed to recognise him until dinnertime, when he took the bread, blessed and broke it then handed it round those at the table. The painting is inspired by the engraving of the same subject in D\u00fcrer\u2019s Small Passion series. The layout of the composition is centred round the figure of Christ, depicted as he breaks the bread. His sudden revelation to the disciples, who recognise him from this gesture, is emphasised by the beam of light that illuminates his face. The table is portrayed with a few simple elements of great naturalism: the metal jug, the clear glasses, the dog and the cats hiding underneath, waiting for the leftovers. The monks of the charterhouse emerge from the darkness in the background, called upon to witness the sacred episode. Among these figures, the piercing portrait of Leonardo Buonafede stands out. The old prior of the charterhouse, he is identified as the monk standing on Christ\u2019s right-hand side. The divine eye at the top, a symbol of God the Father within the trinity triangle, is the result of a posthumous repainting job, designed to conceal the original three-sided face, representing the Trinity, which had been prohibited by the Counter-Reformation."}, {"title": "Annunciation with St. Margaret and St. Ansanus", "artist": "Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1576847910908083-02-simone-martini.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The signed and dated painting was completed for the altar of St. Ansanus in the transept of Siena cathedral, dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. In the painting, the Archangel Gabriel appears to the Virgin Mary to tell her of the forthcoming birth of Jesus and greets her with the words shown on the raised inscription on the gold background: \u201cAVE GRATIA PLENA DOMINUS TECUM\u201d. The angel's appearance is sudden, as suggested by the fluttering cloak and spread wings. Mary is distressed, drawing back and wrapping herself in her cloak. The surrounding environment of the scene is not defined, but the few elements which are depicted - the marble floor, the elaborately engraved throne, the precious fabrics, the book that Mary was reading before the celestial apparition - can be traced back to the lifestyle of the wealthiest classes in the fourteenth century. Above, in the center of the scene, the Holy Spirit is depicted in the form of a dove surrounded by angels, in line with the vase of lilies, a symbol of the Son of God and the purity of the Virgin Mary. The scrolls held by the prophets depicted in the tondos set into the frame allude to the mystery of the incarnation: from the left, Jeremiah, Ezechiel, Isiah and Daniel. The depictions on either side of the Annunciation show the martyr Ansanus, one of the patron saints of Siena and bearing the banner with the city\u2019s colors, and a holy martyr, possibly Maxima, the mother of Ansanus, or Margaret; the inscription at her feet, which identifies her as Judith, is incorrect. However, the inscription indicating the two Sienese painters Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi as the altarpiece's creators is original, although art critics tend to attribute most of the conception and execution of this highly detailed painting to Simone, representing as it does one of the greatest masterpieces of fourteenth century painting in Europe. A friend of the poet Francesco Petrarch and commissioned by illustrious clients such as the House of Anjou and the Avignon Papacy, Simone shared a workshop with Lippo Memmi and the two became brothers-in-law when Simone married Memmi\u2019s sister."}, {"title": "Spring", "artist": "Sandro Botticelli", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1543409158632122-Botticelli-primavera-intero.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "This painting, usually known as the Primavera [or \u2018Spring\u2019] shows nine figures from classic mythology advancing over a flowery lawn in a grove of orange and laurel trees.

The centre of the painting is dominated by the goddess of love and beauty, Venus, chastely dressed and set slightly back from the others, and by a blindfolded Cupid, firing his arrow of love. On the left, the three Graces, minor goddesses with virtues like those of Venus, are shown dancing in a circle. The composition is closed by Mercury, messenger of the Gods, recognisable from his helmet and winged sandals, as he touches a cloud with his staff. Although the complex meaning of the composition remains a mystery, the painting is a celebration of love, peace, and prosperity.  The dark colour of the vegetation is in part due to the ageing process of the original pigment, but is lightened by the abundance of fruits and flowers. At least 138 species of different plants have been identified, all accurately portrayed by Botticelli, perhaps using herbaria. The attention to detail confirms the artist\u2019s commitment to this piece, which is also evident in the sheer skill with which the paint has been applied. It is painted on a poplar wood backing and towards the end of the 15th century, it was to be found in the house in Via Larga (modern-day Via Cavour) that belonged to the heirs of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de\u2019 Medici, cousin of Lorenzo the Magnificent.

In the tradition of the fourteenth century, inspired by the design of ancient coins, the two figures are shown in profile, an angle that ensured a good likeness and a faithful representation of facial details without allowing their sentiments to show through: indeed, the Duke and Duchess of Urbino appear unaffected by turmoil and emotions. The couple are facing each other and the spatial element is suggested by the light and the continuity of the rolling landscape in the background, representing the area of the Marches over which the Duke and Duchess ruled. The chromatic contrast between the bronze skin tones used for Federico and the pale tones of Battista Sforza is striking; the pale pallor of the Duchess not only respects the aesthetic conventions which were fashionable during the Renaissance but could also allude to her untimely death in 1472. On the back of the panels, the Duke and Duchess are featured being carried triumphantly on ancient wagons, accompanied by the Christian virtues; the Latin inscriptions pay tribute to the couple\u2019s moral values. The presence of the images on the reverse side suggests that the two paintings, now set in a modern frame, would once have been part of a diptych. One of the Piero della Francesca's most famous works, the double portrait is representative of the relationship between the painter and the Duke and Duchess of Montefeltro; Piero was a frequent guest at their court, finding himself in a cultured and refined atmosphere which would soon become one of the most important cultural and artistic hearts of Italy. The master painter marries the strict approach to perspective learned during his Florentine education with the lenticular representation more characteristic of Flemish painting, achieving extraordinary results and unmatched originality."}, {"title": "Adoration of the Magi (San Donato in Scopeto)", "artist": "Leonardo da Vinci", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1631786892898661/Leonardo-dopo-restauro.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "A document from July 1481 states that Leonardo da Vinci had received a commission from the Augustinian monks to paint a panel for the high altar in the church of San Donato in Scopeto, outside Florence\u2019s city walls. The painting, which Leonardo undertook to finish within 30 months, had the Adoration of the Magi as its subject, i.e., the celebration of the feast of the Epiphany when, according to St Augustine, all people respond to the call of Christ. For this subject, Leonardo studied an extremely complex composition, rich with figures, set out in a semi-circle, with the Virgin and Child as the focus. In the foreground, the kneeling Magi offer their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to Jesus. Leonardo has painted a background with ruined buildings and clashes between knights on horseback, while on the left, we can see work on a building, perhaps a temple, with in the foreground, two flights of stairs, like the presbytery of several Mediaeval churches (San Miniato al Monte in Florence, for example). The temple, which alludes to peace, contrasts with the upset of the fighting horses on the other side. In September 1481, Leonardo was still working on the painting, but later he left Florence for the court of Ludovico Sforza in Milan, interrupting the painting he was producing for the church of San Donato in Scopeto. The Augustinian friars waited in vain for the artist to return and to complete his painting, until they decided to commission another altarpiece with the Adoration of the Magi from Filippino Lippi, which was completed in 1496. Leonardo\u2019s Adoration of the Magi is therefore a painting that is suspended in execution to an initial level of a rough sketch. Leonardo took the development of the work to different stages: some of the characters are barely sketched out, while others, as if to grasp an idea, are more finished.

A leading figure in Rome in the 1610s of the artistic revolution which swept across Europe, in this painting Caravaggio demonstrates a masterful naturalistic portrayal of still life. His depiction of the basket of fruit and the cup of wine proffered by the god is surprising, with such elements interpreted by some critics as a Horatian invitation to frugality, conviviality and friendship. The sculpted figure of Bacchus with a stunned expression due to inebriation reproduces models of the classical art, in particular the portraits of Antinous, and is instilled with a languid sensuality. In the painting, eminent art critic Mina Gregori detected a certain vision of antiquity celebrating the freedom of senses, as well as a reference to the Bacchic costumes and initiation rites practiced in Rome.

In his biography of the artist, Giorgio Vasari says that the painting was commissioned for the marriage of Lorenzo Nasi with Sandra di Matteo Canigiani, celebrated on 23 February 1506. When, the Nasi home was destroyed by a landslide in 1547, the painting was broken into seventeen fragments and probably given to Michele di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio for restoration. Its subsequent history is unknown, until it is recorded as being part of the collection of Cardinal Giovan Carlo de\u2019 Medici in 1646-47. During his Florentine period, Raphael painted other works on the theme of the group of the Virgin Mary with Jesus and the young John the Baptist, in which he was able to make use of all of his experience from Urbino and Florence (see, for example, the \u201cMadonna in the Meadow\u201d in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, and the \u201cBelle Jardini\u00e8re\u201d in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris). The pyramid composition reflects the deep impression made on him by the lost cartoon for the \u201cVirgin and Child with St Anne\u201d by Leonardo, displayed from the beginning of the century in the Church of the Santissima Annunziata, as well as the \u201cMadonna of Bruges\u201d by Michelangelo, sculpted before summer 1506. By studying the laws of proportion in nature and in the works of Perugino, Fra\u2019 Bartolomeo and Leonardo, Raphael was able to create images of an ideal, harmonious beauty that was not only perfect in its simplicity but also vital and dynamic, due to the intense exchanges of looks and gestures that link the figures as well as to the graceful variety of the expressions, made more natural by using Leonardo\u2019s \u2018sfumato\u2019 technique, which Raphael also used to dissolve the background into the atmosphere on the horizon. This is such a modern image, yet it still contains symbolic elements from traditional worship, such as the small holy text in the Virgin\u2019s hand \u2013 a sign of her faith and a foreshadowing of the sacrifice of Christ, which is also evoked by the innocently fragile goldfinch that the young St John is holding out so that the Christ Child may caress it."}, {"title": "Virgin and Child enthroned, surrounded by angels and saints (Ognissanti Maest\u00e0)", "artist": "Giotto", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1576847881954536-01-giotto.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Mary, holding Jesus in her arms, is seated on a throne, like a queen.

Inside this tabernacle is a group of saints and angels. The angels, who are kneeling at the foot of the throne, offer vases of roses and lilies, a reference to purity and charity, while the ones to the side of the throne are holding out a crown and a pyx, a religious item that likely refers to the Passion of Christ. The saints are partly covered by the architecture and halos, which as well as suggesting the existence of a solid space in which the figures have been placed, serve also to evoke the name of the church for which the painting was created: Ognissanti in Florence. The original position of the painting inside the church is unknown, but it is possible that it was hung over a side altar or on a partition dividing the secular space from the choir of the Humiliati monks who officiated in the church. Giotto continued to work for Ognissanti during his career, painting at least two more works. Painted when the artist was already extremely well known and greatly in demand all over Italy, the masterpiece stands out for the naturalism with which it develops this traditional subject.

In the summer of 1536, the duke asked for the return of his parade armour, sent to Venice a few months beforehand so that Titian could reproduce it faithfully in the portrait that he was painting, making the most of the presence of the Duke of Urbino in Venice in his capacity as General Captain of the Serenissima.   Titian portrays Francesco Maria to mid thigh level, with his Venetian baton in his fist and wearing a polished suit of armour that stands out against a background of crimson velvet cloth. Under the armour, as can be seen from the sleeves, the Duke is wearing an outfit in black and yellow, the heraldic colours of the Montefeltro house, to remind us that he belongs to this family as the son of Giovanna da Montefeltro and the grandson of famous condottiere, Federico. On the shelf behind him, to the left, is a helmet topped by a dragon, while on the right are the batons of command of the papacy, Florence, and Venice, with an oak branch in reference to the blood line of Francesco Maria and the house of della Rovere and its illustrious member, his uncle, Pope Julius II. Together with the Portrait of Eleonora Gonzaga, his wife, painted as a companion to that of her husband, the portrait arrived in the Ducal Palace of Pesaro in the spring of 1538, but not before it had been admired by Pietro Aretino.  The excellent artistry of the paintings was declaimed by Aretino in two sonnets that reinforced the depictions of the duke and duchess, making them even clearer examples of complementary virtues, conveyed by Titian in his paintings. The expression on the duke\u2019s face, together with his pose are obvious reflections of the moral qualities of a great condottiere: courage, pride, wisdom and honour. The painting is therefore one of the most successful examples of Titian\u2019s skills as a portrait artist of great importance, destined to pass effigies of the \u201cworld\u2019s powerful\u201d down through the centuries."}, {"title": "Charity", "artist": "Francesco de Rossi, known as Salviati", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1591717486870043/1581608725292125-3-Salviati_carita.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The young woman kneeling in the foreground stands out against the drapes in the background.

Salviati has constructed the four figures as if they were a single body, connecting each movement harmoniously within a highly sophisticated balance of elements to create one of the most effective examples of what Vasari called the \u2018Bella Maniera\u2019. The composition is inspired by the undisputed cornerstone of early 16th century Florentine painting: Michelangelo\u2019s \u2018Doni Tondo\u2019 , mirrored here in the poses of both the female figure and the three children. However, the sinuous fluidity, languid expressions and exquisite nature of the details in the surroundings are more specifically reminiscent of the cultural hub that had been developing since the mid-1520s at the court of Clement VII in Rome. There, artists from different origins - including Parmigianino, Perin del Vaga, Giulio Romano, Rosso, Sansovino and others \u2013 had come together with results that would influence the direction of painting through to the final decades of the century.

According to a more recent, and picturesque theory from critics, the painting is a portrait of Cleitus, valiant lieutenant and close friend of Alexander the Great, about to mount his horse before heading off to one of the many military expeditions into Asia. The work would seem to be based on the painting model used by great Greek artist, Apelles, well known to Giorgone at the time, through the descriptions passed down from Pliny the Elder.

The episode, set in a vast landscape, bordered by a fortified wall, \u201calla moderna\u201d, is taken from the Old Testament (Daniel, XIII, 1-64): Susanna, the beautiful and chaste bride of Joachim, a rich Jew, is propositioned by two elders whilst taking a bath in her garden. In their attempt to take advantage of her, they threaten to accuse her publicly of adultery. Only the intervention of the prophet Daniel, who questions the two old men separately and since they contradict one another, they reveal their lie and prove Susanna\u2019s innocence. In the painting, Susanna has removed her clothes and can be seen kneeling in a position comparable to that of the Crouching Venus, familiar through the Roman copies of the 3rd century BC Greek original. With her arm outstretched, Susanna wards off the two old men and pronounces the phrase on the scroll: Satius duco mori, quam peccare (I would rather die than sin). One of the elders then pronounces the unfounded accusation of adultery: \u201cVidimus eam cum iuvene commisceri, ni nobis assenties testimonio nostro peribus\u201c (We bear witness that we have seen her lay with a youth, who then fled). The two scrolls make direct reference to the biblical text of the Prophet Daniel, translated into images in the painting. There is an evident message in praise of feminine virtue and justice, transmitted through the work using a formal language that is strongly influenced by accents of Leonardo da Vinci.

They are offered up to our view as an important document of Italian fashions in women\u2019s clothing in the 16th century.

The canvas stands out for its originality, also from an iconographic viewpoint: St Anne is leaning against the step on a four-poster bed, with her legs open with the Virgin and the Baby Jesus between them, singularly and vividly representing in this manner, the concept of their descending from her womb. The presence of St Jerome, on the left, pointing to the Holy Family with his open hand, may be a reference to the person who commissioned the work, named Jerome.

Judith went to the encampment of the fierce Holofernes, general of the enemy army, dressed in her best clothes and feigning a wish to forge an alliance. Struck by her beauty, the Assyrian general invited her to a lavish banquet in his tent. After eating and drinking, Holofernes, now drunk, fell asleep on his bed, allowing Judith to seize her chance to draw her scimitar and strike the deadly blow. In this powerful painting in the Gallery of the Statues and Paintings of the Uffizi, (c. 1620), Artemisia Gentileschi portrays the moment that Holofernes is killed by the hand of the determined and powerful Judith. The overall effect is both powerful and frightening: the drunk corpulent general is lying on the bed, his head grasped by his hair and the sword plunged into his neck. Furthermore, Artemisia did not shy away from adding the gory detail of blood spurting so profusely as to stain Judith's breast. The painting was completed in Rome where Artemisia returned after spending seven years in Florence and where she was able to appreciate Caravaggio's works once more. The naturalistic \u201cvirility\u201d of the work provoked strong reactions on its arrival in Florence and the painting was denied the honor of being exhibited in the Gallery; in fact, it was only with great difficulty and the help of her friend Galileo Galilei that the painter managed to extract the payment, with a significant delay, that had been agreed with Grand Duke Cosimo II de\u2019 Medici, who died in 1621 shortly after the great canvas was completed.

In 1470 he married Maria Baroncelli, also of Florence; the family is depicted with clothing and hairstyles that reflect the Flemish fashion of the time. During his time in Flanders, Tommaso Portinari commissioned Flemish painter Hugo van der Goes to paint the Adoration of the Shepherds Triptych to adorn the Portinari family chapel in the church of Saint Giles in the Santa Maria Nuova hospital in Florence. The painting's arrival in Florence in 1483, having first reached Pisa by sea, was quite an event; the work was perceived to be extraordinarily innovative in the eyes of the Florentine painters, who particularly praised the realistic likeness of the objects, landscape and facial features. The still life imagery in the central foreground is astonishing and abounds with symbolic references: the white iris and red lily allude to the theme of purity and Jesus\u2019 blood spilled during the Passion of the Christ, the purple columbine represents the sorrow of the Virgin Mary, while the carnations symbolize the Holy Trinity.

This theme was particularly popular in Florence in the fifteenth century when it was depicted on rectangular panels, and this painting in the Uffizi is the only fully intact example still in existence today. In the landscape, numerous scenes from the legendary lives of various saints, including Saint Onuphrius and Saint Anthony, are alternated with scenes of daily life - the saint drawing water from the well, the saint riding a deer and the group carrying an elder on a stretcher, for example - which outline the monks\u2019 path to ascension. The luxuriant landscape is dominated by a river flowing into the sea and is filled with trees, a metaphor of the spiritual garden where the virtuous ascetics would prosper.

The painting, which had previously been interpreted as a depiction of Charity because of the very human affection between the woman and the two children, is striking for its unusual use of light and the dramatic encroaching shadows which allude almost inevitably to the future deposition of Christ. The use of bright colors typical of Pontormo\u2019s work brings a surreal element to the composition which assumes a dreamlike, theatrical quality. The painting is characterized by a subtle but intentional return to a Leonardesque style, onto which the artist employs a technique to create the shapes of the bodies inspired by Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel ceiling. In fact, Pontormo's use of pure color to render the front and back of the bodies appears to be derived directly from Michelangelo's work. The striking Madonna, whose figure is also Michelangelesque in shape, bends forward to embrace the Baby Jesus sat upon her knee and the young Saint Join on the right. The twisting body and poignant expression of the young Saint John, as well as the Child's extended leg, are reminiscent of works such as the Medici Madonna created by Michelangelo during the same period. The work's incompletion may be due to its effective coincidence with the siege of Florence (from October 1529 to August 1530), a difficult period for the people of Florence and which likely had a profound effect on Pontormo's sensitive character, leading him to intensify his use of shapes, colors and lights throughout his works."}, {"title": "Virgin and Child, and Angels (Madonna of the Magnificat)", "artist": "Sandro Botticelli", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1576847984589645-06-botticelli.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The Virgin Mary, crowned by two angels, is depicted on a throne.

The iconography is inspired by the vision of the birth of Christ experienced by St Bridget of Sweden in Bethlehem in 1372. In her Revelations, the saint relates that\u201d the Virgin then took off her shoes [\u2026] knelt with great reverence as if in prayer, with her hands stretched out in front of her and, then and there, in a moment and the twinkling of an eye, she gave birth to a Son. The newborn child suddenly appeared on the ground radiating an ineffable light. When the Virgin realised that she had given birth, she said to the Child: \u201cWelcome, my God, my Lord, and my Son!\u201d In the clear, esoteric dawn atmosphere, a beautiful, sweet Virgin kneels in front of the newborn Child, gazing at him with tenderness. The Child is returning his mother\u2019s gaze, reaching out his tiny hand, as babies do, as he tries to grab her robe. The intimate bond between mother and child is emphasised by the fact that the baby has been set down on a piece of his mother\u2019s robe. With a few simple gestures, Coreggio masterfully conveys the tender affectionate gestures exchanged between Virgin and Child"}, {"title": "Adoration of the Magi", "artist": "Filippino Lippi", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1540556003683493-princ.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "This composition is so rich with characters that it is difficult to recognise the three kings who have come from the east to pay homage to the Christ Child, and who kneel before him offering their precious gifts in elegantly made pots.

Among the figures in the retinue of the magi, our attention is drawn to the kneeling man to the left wearing a sumptuous, fur-lined yellow robe and who carries an astrolabe, alluding to the astrological knowledge of the magi. This figure is thought to be Pier Francesco de\u2019 Medici (1430-1476), to whom the Augustinian friars from the church of San Donato a Scopeto in Florence, who commissioned the work, evidently wanted to pay homage. Pier Francesco's sons, Lorenzo (1463-1503) and Giovanni (1467-1498) are perhaps recognizable as the king being crowned and the young blond alongside him, holding the vase. The scene is set in a country landscape, in front of a stable over which the star that guided the kings is shining.  In the background, there are scenes of their journey, from the sighting of the star to their passage via Herod\u2019s palace.

At this time, D\u00fcrer had already travelled to Italy once and was therefore familiar with ancient artworks and Italian art (in particular, the works by Mantegna, Bellini, and Leonardo). In Nuremberg (his birthplace), the young Durer had had occasion to see prints, coins, medals and engraved gems brought to the city, thanks to a busy trade with Northern Italy. In this Adoration, although taking the Nordic models into account (Dieric Bouts and David Gerardi, for its references to mixed architecture, to broken arches and precarious wooden structures), the master expresses his art in an \u201cItalian-style\u201d language, choosing to represent just a few, solidly constructed figures that move through a well-constructed space. The bearded king kneeling and bending towards the Child evokes, for example, Leonardo and specifically the Wise Man and the figure of the old man leaning out, both in the Adoration of the Magi at the Uffizi, recently restored and displayed in the Gallery after a lengthy absence. The king shown in profile is also rather Leonardesque in style, and is thought to be based on D\u00fcrer himself, a man with long, blond curls recalling the self-portrait at the Prado. The whole scene is described in elegant detail and search for particulars: fabrics, brocades, crowns and goblets (made by goldsmiths in Nuremberg), rubies, pearls, the Virgin\u2019s veil, feathers, animals, and plants, all according to Flemish tastes from the other side of the Alps. The colour selection is also worth mentioning: in the foreground, the red, green and blue; in the background, the blue of sky and sea with a palette that becomes lighter and brighter as it opens out onto a fairy tale landscape, with knights and a village in the distance. The iconographic choice is focused on the main characters: the Virgin showing the Christ Child to the three Wise Men, who have brought gifts of gold, incense and myrrh.

It is a recurring setting in paintings of the Nativity and the Adoration of the Christ Child, and one that alludes to the birth of Christianity and the collapse of pagan religion. The decorative friezes on the portico are inspired by ancient Roman art, which Domenico Ghirlandaio was able to admire on his travels to Rome where, among other things, he worked on the decorations of the Sistine Chapel in St Peter\u2019s Basilica. The Virgin and Child are the focus of the composition; the Wise Men are kneeling before them, recognizable by the crowns that they have placed at the feet of the Saviour. A servant, whose dark skin emphasizes that the kings and their large following have come from the East, is removing the diadem from the head of the youngest Magi.  The crowd is arranged in a wide semi-circle, echoing the circular shape of the panel, characteristic of a type of painting created for private worship and destined for the homes of the most wealthy, often on occasion of marriages of birth. The imposing dimensions of this work seem to indicate that it is a commission of the highest level. There is a tendency to identify it as the \u201ctondo\u201d of the Adoration of the Magi, described in a 1498 inventory for Palazzo Tornabuoni in Florence, in the room of Lorenzo Tornabuoni (1468-1497). The subject of the Nativity and the date, MCCCCLXXXVII written on the marble block in the foreground, lead us to think that this panel could have been painted on the occasion of the birth of Giovanni Tornabuoni, first born of Lorenzo Tornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizi, born in 1487. The head of the family, Lorenzo is possibly recognizable as the man with long black hair, kneeling on the right. As in murals, even the smaller size of paintings on panel, Ghirlandaio maintains his capacity to orchestrate complex crowd scenes, with many details and costumes, numerous portraits and natural pieces depicted with extraordinary verisimilitude, thanks to the lesson learned from Flemish painting.

A little further on, a staircase rises from the bottom to the top: the artist attributes to this element not only a structural function, as a stage backdrop, but also a symbolic meaning. In fact, by connecting the figures of Mary and Joseph to heaven, the ladder helps the observer's gaze make an upward movement, thus relating earthly events to divine will. The central thematic nucleus of the painting is the adoration of the shepherds. In the foreground, three men dressed modestly and with faces marked by fatigue are contemplating the child, lying on a white cloth on the hay. The tender innocence of the newborn baby, intent on sucking his own little hand, contrasts with the rough and rugged appearance of the shepherds, who are nevertheless absorbed in sincere and heartfelt adoration. Mary and Joseph witness with simplicity and participation the unexpected arrival of these men, who were considered the last men by the Jewish society of the time, and yet were participants in the divine event. A suffused atmosphere, woven by a soft, warm chromatism reminiscent of Titian's painting, pervades the scene. Light radiates delicately from the newborn Jesus and the graceful choir of angels who, like a miniature scene, appear in the heavens to glorify the Saviour. The panel seems attributable to Garofalo's maturity. In fact, unlike works of a similar subject attributable to his younger years, it is characterised by a dark colour scheme and is influenced by the encounter with the art of Giulio Romano, which can be seen above all in its spatial layout."}, {"title": "Afternoon in Fiesole (Self portrait)", "artist": "Baccio Maria Bacci", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1579007996703482-2.baccio-maria-bacci.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "A peaceful postprandial scene: four friends are chatting around a table in a house that is easily recognisable as the painter\u2019s home in Fiesole, near Florence.

Baccio Maria Bacci was born into a family of artists and after his beginnings with the international avant garde, began to take an active part in Futurism, and after significant periods in Paris and Switzerland and the First World War, he settled in Fiesole. His references - in this period - are the oldest, traditional Renaissance and the more recent, Macchiaioli. Both inspired the artist to create a style with a solid, harmonious spatial and volumetric approach. He exhibited with a personal room at the 1921 Fiorentina Primaverile, where critics appreciated his \u201cpurified naturalism\u201d and pointed out his desire to \u201crestore to painting those decorative, architectural, and stylistic elements that had been banished by the partial, ephemeral aesthetic of impressionism.\u201d (Mario Tinti). Throughout the 1920s, he continued to produce work as one of the \u201cGruppo Novecentesco Toscano\u201d, in the style of that particular classicism that renewed the Macchiaiolo traditions with its matrix of 20th-century values. \u201cAfternoon in Fiesole\u201d is a work that is emblematic of these values and of the concept of the painting, as already highlighted by Tinti in 1921, \u201cas a total expression - story, poem, novel\u201d. The different painting genres, the portrait, the still life on the table top, the genre scene and the painting of a reassuring landscape of the very Tuscan hills seen from the room, come together within the space of the painting, while a warm light, painted from life sits evenly over the whole composition.

The goddess is portrayed balancing on a globe, a symbol of the instability by which she is characterised. The red wings on her left foot indicate her fleetingness. On her right, a crown with a sceptre, an inkwell, two books and a ruler fall from above, all symbols of earthly powers and trades that are subject to the goddess\u2019s volubility. The coins sliding into the vase from a purse and coming out of its transformed into butterflies represent the transience of wealth. A winged figure, possibly a depiction of Time or Death, is offering Fortune a tray with an hourglass and some flowers, a reminder of the passing of time and the transitory nature of worldly goods. The fragile glass vase that the goddess is holding on the right-hand side could be a tribute to the interest that Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, paid to this kind of object. In fact, glass fusing, an activity Francesco practised as a hobby, was linked to the studies of alchemy, a branch of philosophy for which the Grand Duke harboured a passionate enthusiasm. Besides, Ligozzi, then a court painter, was one of the artists appointed to provide models for the most varied forms of glass windows, to be made in the foundries of the Medici. Of the many drawings of this type produced by the artist and preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings of the Uffizi, there is one that, viewed close-up, resembles the vase painted in this work. This detail adds credibility to the attribution of the work to Ligozzi, a theory debated by critics in the past. The detail of the butterflies, painted in a highly realistic way, reminds us that Ligozzi\u2019s speciality was creating illustrations of plants and animals. Indeed, he produced many of these for both the Grand Duke and for the Bolognese academic and naturalist, Ulisse Aldrovandi. The artist\u2019s refined technical prowess won him the favour of Francesco I: the Grand Duke appointed him to lead the pictorial decoration of the Tribune of the Uffizi, today partially lost, which consisted in an imaginative and multi-coloured composition of naturalia."}, {"title": "Allegory of Painting", "artist": "Giovanni Martinelli", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1567766034301564-5.Martinelli-allegoria2.JPG?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The girl emerges from the shadows in the background, with no other spatial detail except for the edge of the table, bottom left, and a cushion decorated with a tassel.

In her hands she clasps a number of brushes and a sheet of paper on which some faint drawings in red pencil can be made out, symbols that allude to her role as a figure of the art of painting, and also correspond to the criterion of Ripa\u2019s Iconologia : \u201cA beautiful woman, with thick black hair, dishevelled and twisted in various ways, with arched eyebrows that show imaginative thought.\u2026She holds a brush in one hand and a palette in the other, and is draped in evanescent robes, which cover her feet. At these feet one can make out a number of Painting tools,  showing that Painting is a noble art which cannot be practised without the diligent application of intellect\u201d. Perhaps due to the subject of the work, as well as to its bright colours which feature many changes in tone, the Allegory of Painting was included in the late 18th-century inventories as a self-portrait by Venetian artist, Chiara Varotari, daughter of Dario and sister of the more famous Alessandro, known as Il Padovanino. However, there are good reasons for identifying it as a Florentine piece from the early 17th century, painted by Giovanni Martinelli, influenced here by the works of Artemisia Gentileschi and Simon Vouet, through whom he probably encountered naturalism in the style of Caravaggio.

The chivalric poems of Ariosto and Tasso were popular subjects, especially in 16th- and 17th-century paintings, both in terms of their literary and mythical content and because of the kaleidoscopic variety of stories lived by the protagonists which were excellent for providing moral interpretations. In Florence in particular, customers were thrilled at the vicissitudes of heroes and heroines, covering the rooms in palaces and suburban villas with canvases depicting stories from Orlando Furioso, Jerusalem Delivered and even Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses. The en plein air settings give the scene its pretty rural tone so dear to Florentine painters in the 1630s, impressed by the new themes from Rome that arrived in Florence via the city's artists and by means of works added to the Medici and other noble collections.

Although he had escaped Alcina\u2019s charms on the island, Ruggiero cannot fight the fact that he has fallen in love with the young girl at first sight, on account of her eyes and her beauty (Ruggiero turns and with thick kisses plies/the lady\u2019s breast and sparkling eyes) Overcome with desire, he decides to possess Angelica and thus, at the end of the canto are three memorable verses with an irresistible comic crescendo of emotion as clumsy Ruggiero tries to disrobe, making more and more of a muddle of things.  Confused by different throng, Ruggiero did his shining arms undo/Never the task appeared to him so long/For where he loosed one knot, he fastened two.

There are other versions of these subjects painted by Bilivert in the same period, but slightly different in size or in some of the details. Among these is a smaller canvas in the Palatine Gallery (Inv. 1890/8034), one in Prato (Palazzo degli Alberti, Banca Popolare di Vicenza), and one in Florence in Palazzo Vecchio, as well as a miniature on a stone slab (Florence, Opificio delle Pietre Dure museum) and a small bronze group by Ferdinando Tacca, now in the Louvre. Like the canvas of Rinaldo and Armida by Cesare Dandini (Inv. 1890 no. 3823), Bilivert\u2019s canvas was conceived as an accompaniment to other subjects with the same moral intent, taken from the great epic tales. The scene with Angelica and Ruggiero in particular, signifies the loss of reason caused by man giving in to vice and passion. In the other example, now in the Palatine Gallery and taken from the apartment of the Cardinal Dean, Carlo de Medici, at the Casino Mediceo, Angelica is veiled by a curtain which it is thought was added following criticism of her nudity by the Grand Duchess, Christina of Lorraine.

Within the artist's production, a term of comparison on this same theme can be found in the Annunciation painted in 1528, now in the Capitoline Picture Gallery in Rome. The work is dated well after Garofalo's second stay in Rome, when the artist developed a language that harmonises and synthesises all the elements gained from his training and experience: from the classical grace reminiscent of Raphael, greatly appreciated at the court of Alfonso d'Este in Ferrara, where Garofalo worked on several occasions, to the rendering of space learned in Rome from Giulio Romano, found here as a personal reworking. The scene expands, leading the eye to the perspectives of the landscape and the Virgin's bedroom, the most intimate place in the house.

The protagonist is one of the most intense and moving figures in Jerusalem Delivered by Torquato Tasso: a beautiful Muslim princess, extremely gifted in the art of magic, is sent by her uncle to the Christian army, with the task of distracting the soldiers with her cunning and seduction. Falling hopelessly in love with the crusader, Rinaldo, Armida abducts him to take him to the Fortunate Isles, conjuring up a palace and enchanted gardens in order to keep him there. Carlo and Ubaldo, companions of Rinaldo, are able to enter the fairytale kingdom, where they find the young man and convince him to return to his army. The abandoned Armida falls into despair and fury. She climbs to the top of the mountain, calls to her all the spirits of hell and then leaves to join the Egyptian ranks in order to get revenge.  This is the image chosen for the painting by Cecco Bravo, where the bold sensuality of the young woman is accentuated by the transparencies of her clothing and by the pearls and ribbons she wears.  The regular profile of her face is like that of an antique cameo, emphasised by full lips, eyes looking off into the horizon, and the arm lifting the magical sceptre. An astonishing variety of animals surround her: dragons, serpents and demons from the circles of Hell as described by Tasso. Never truly frightening, but rather bizarre and subservient to the satirical, burlesque vein that flows through Florentine paintings from the mid-17th century, becoming a particular feature, these monsters seem inspired by the limitless range of inventions taken from ancient grotesques and the variations they offered to the whole Mannerist generation and beyond, through to the dazzling sorcery of Salvator Rosa. The scene is not complete because the canvas has been cut down on the left side, so there is a piece missing that perhaps corresponds to a section of landscape that contained other fantastical apparitions. The painting therefore must have been wider than it is today. It has been dated back to the 1650s, as suggested by scholars, and critics have agreed that from a style viewpoint, it is like that of Cecco from the same period. After his initial training at the workshops of Rosselli and Bilivert, Cecco was seeking his own original path, which included travel to study in the north, reflections on Venetian culture, and participation in the freer examples of painting by his contemporary, Francesco Furini. His research is hesitant in its effusive style, with paintings built around brush strokes in strident colour, in contrasting transparencies and more consistent uses of texture, with flashes of light and back light effects. In the period around the middle of the century, Montelatici definitively abandoned the vein of naturalism that characterised his works until the 1940s, making way for compositions in which space is less three dimensional, the main scene is pushed into the foreground and the backgrounds fade into distant, blurred landscapes, veiled in tones of grey.

She studied painting with Jacopo Ligozzi and singing with Francesca Caccini, performing before the court of the grand duchy in the church of Santa Felicita and in Palazzo Pitti. In 1616 she married a Flemish tapestry maker, Jan Broomans from Antwerp, from whom she learned the profession, becoming so skilled that she became well known, not only as a favourite \u201csinger\u201d for the Medici house, but also as \u201cArcangiola ricamatora\u201d or tapestry maker.

During the 1950s, her highly original abstract medium, centred on the serial repetition of a black and white sign-colour, placed her in the sphere of the Informal movement; she took part in numerous exhibitions curated by the critic Michel Tapi\u00e9 in Italy and abroad. During the 1960s, she experimented with the use of new materials, recovering colour, now applied with fluorescent paints and light refraction, almost optical effects. She also introduced sicofoil as a support for painting, a transparent plastic material previously only used in industry. After the 1970s, having also experimented with the environmental dimension, Accardi returned to working on the format of the painting, again using the canvas as a support. The compositions, such as this Self-portrait, were now structured on large, uniform monochrome backgrounds. The colour was applied with very careful, controlled gestures, the homogeneity of which is emphasised by the choice of vinyl, which gives great compactness to the surface, while maintaining a natural, non-glossy effect. In this composition, wide, sinuous curved lines harmonise with sharp angles and straight lines; the cold cerulean hue is balanced with purplish red; the painting as a whole is in rhythmic harmony with the rough canvas background, deliberately left clearly visible.

Going beyond academic conventions, the painter has chosen his home studio as the setting, portraying himself in the midst of his family setting, almost outside the picture, as he leaves the focus on his smiling wife and two small children: the oldest riding a stick and the youngest, holding a rattle and sitting, puzzled, on a cart pulled by his father. The painting also hides a bold joke and constitutes evidence of professional pride.  In fact, in the centre of the scene, apparently placed in the background, is a canvas on an easel.

The depiction of the artist\u2019s studio is very interesting: lying around on the floor there is a marble bust that must have been used as a model; not far away a brazier with burning coals heats and lights up the bare room; a sketch on paper and a framed oil painting of the crucified figure of the Good Thief can be seen on the wall. This painting certainly makes reference to Cerquozzi\u2019s artistic activities. He painted this subject, much appreciated by Roman collectors, several times. The documents found relating to the painter\u2019s studio, which was on the Pincio in Rome, indicate that the materials and objects kept in it were of roughly the same sort, while historical sources suggest that the artist used Romans as models, in accordance with the custom of painters who adopted Caravaggio\u2019s style. Therefore, it is an accurate description of the work place of the painter who wanted to portray himself and his activities in his usual living space. From a stylistic point of view, the light and colour choices are characteristic of Cerquozzi\u2019s painting and the methods that he absorbed during his association with the painter Jacob de Hase, known as Giacomo Fiammingo.

The series of photographs and videos extend the duration of the performances, which are necessarily confined to a limited space and duration: much more than simple documentation, they are works in themselves that the artist progressively numbers with her initials and those of the project in question.

Explicitly recalling the iconography of a Renaissance Madonna, she breastfeeds two twins that she will unsuccessfully attempt to adopt. The other VBSS photographs are equally inspired by the Christian iconographic repertoire (black women with babies on their laps, male figures as crucifixes): with these images, and with the performance at the Venice Biennale in 2007, Beecroft intended to denounce the horror of the Darfur war.

This scene from the Unification of Italy was carefully chosen by Guttuso as a paradigmatic example of the ideals of resistance and freedom which fueled the partisan Resistance during the Second World War and finally led to Italy\u2019s liberation from Nazi-Fascist occupation. The topicality of the unification battle is emphasized in the faces of some of the soldiers, painted by Guttuso to resemble his lifelong companions and comrades from the partisan movement. Moreover, the artist includes two self-portraits, one in the fallen peasant in the foreground at the bottom left of the painting and the other in the Garibaldian soldier with the drawn saber stood on the right side of the painting. \u201cI wanted to recreate the historic context through a link with modernity.

This birthing tray was painted by Pontormo for the birth of Alderighi della Casa, the first son of Girolamo della Casa and Lisabetta Tornaquinci, born in Florence on 15 January 1527. Ritualistic objects like this were already obsolete at the time, but Pontormo, who had worked with master carpenters in Andrea del Sarto\u2019s workshop on the decorations for the carnival carriages of 1513, would have had lots of time to try his hand at making something of this kind. In fact, by shaping it from a single piece of poplar wood, he was able to show off all his technical expertise in this field. The front of the plate shows a shield with the spouses\u2019 coats of arms, alongside two anthropomorphic grotesques, with extremely expressive weird, beaked faces. The painted frame, a perfect imitation of porphyry, is also admirable. The Birth of St John the Baptist is depicted on the back.

The diagonal position directs the beholder\u2019s gaze towards St Elizabeth, who has just given birth and is sitting on the bed, watching her husband Zachary write down the name he will decide on for their son. Other maidservants are bustling round the bed. Even when working in the small space offered by the tray, Pontormo does not forgo the characteristic features of the painting style present in his large-scale works. In fact, the serious nature of the composition is reminiscent of his paintings for the Galluzzo Charter House, and his organisation of the characters in a circle in the undefined space of the room recalls the Supper in Emmaus.

This loose composition of three figures, each of whom appears independent and without a real spatial and psychological relationship with the others, is due to the fact that the painting dates back to many years later, based on models already prepared by Suttermans and his workshop. The grand duchess is almost faithfully copied from the portrait with her son, Ferdinando (Inv. 1890 no. 2246), while the portrait of Cosimo comes from much older examples, such as the one from the courtly series (Inv. 1890 no. 2245, where it appears to be reversed and in official clothing), and it seems to be taken in particular from the oval in the Corsini collection, painted some time around 1620. As for Ferdinando, now an adult, while he was actually just eleven years old when his father died, the portrait is similar to other canvases from the early 1640s (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Inv. no. 8003; and Sestri Levante, Galleria Rizzi - from the Guadagni collection). The canvas seems to be a dynastic commemoration in honour of Cosimo II, a cultured, balanced ruler, with the allegory for Justice on his armour - perhaps in reference to the symbolic role of exemplum virtutis, which inspired both Maria Maddalena in her capacity as regent and Ferdinando, his legitimate successor. The portrait also stands out for its extraordinary display of clothing and jewels, which are also extremely interesting in terms of costume history. The grand duchess is wearing a black dress with a petticoat in silver and gold, topped with a wide lace collar. Ferdinando wears a cloak with the cross of the Knights of St Stephen, an order created and supported by his great-grandfather, Cosimo I. The most interesting piece is the tiara in pearls and precious stones worn by Maria Maddalena, set with the Fiorentino, a 138-carat diamond purchased by Ferdinando I in 1601 and preserved among the Medici treasures until the end of the dynasty. It was taken to Vienna, where it remained in the imperial collection until the early 19th century, before disappearing into nothing, perhaps to make other gems or just sold and since then, nothing more is known about it."}, {"title": "Crucified Christ", "artist": "Maestro del Crocifisso Corsi", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1631101385220837/4-Maestro-del-Crocifisso-Corsi.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The dead Christ is shown with his lifeless body on bent knees, held in place by the nails in his hands and feet.

The painter is clearly inspired by Giotto, his contemporary, but has a harsher, more poignant painting style.

The type of cross, with a historiated panel, is quite common in Tuscan painting between the 12th and 13th centuries.

This natural inclination towards classicism was the result of his training, inspired by the models of Raphael and filtered through the methods of Bolognese artist Carracci. In fact, at around the age of twenty, Guido, who was already an experienced artist, joined the famous Accademia degli Incamminati, the school of painting founded by Annibale Carracci with his brother Agostino and cousin Ludovico. It was set on recovering the example set by the great Masters of the 16th century and focused on anatomy and life drawing. Throughout his successful career, Guido Reni maintained the light-filled composure and figurative clarity that have often led to his works being set against the naturalism and dark theatrical style of the Caravaggisti. There was, however, a short period in which, having moved to Rome in the early 17th century, Reni discovered an openness to the tones and methods of Caravaggio, capturing some of the more superficial aspects, such as the strong contrasts of light or the preference for historical scenes linked to bloody episodes.A certain icy coldness permeated his figures which, even in their crudest poses, still preserved elements of melancholy elegance. This is the case for this David with the Head of Goliath in the Uffizi: a subject that is most certainly in keeping with the repertoire of the Caravaggisti, but is portrayed here with elegant detachment rather than tragic sentiment. David\u2019s pose is that of a dandy, with red feathered hat and his body illuminated by a moonlike light and barely covered by a rich cloak trimmed with fur; the light softly defines his body, while the shadow is propagated from the background. The youth is contemplating the giant severed head of Goliath; the action has already taken place and the drama has already melted into meditation.

These elements can be found in the painting, but the fact that there is food on the table that has already been eaten, such as the squeezed lemon half next to an elegantly decorated pie, or the bread, broken into pieces, rather conveys the idea of a corner in a well-stocked kitchen, where the preparations are in progress for a lavish meal.

The saint is dressed in priestly robes and is depicted secretly tossing three golden balls through a window so as not to get recognition and gratitude in the earthly world, but the approval of God. The high social status of the family rescued by Saint Nicholas is reflected by the sophisticated clothes worn by the daughters and their father. The young women wear tiaras on their heads and the man wears a scarlet robe, headdress, and gloves. The panel, together with the compartment showing the Birth of Saint Nicholas (Contini Bonacossi Inv.

From his early Florentine works, he displayed a particularly original style, characterised by a strong anti-classical energy, which tended to break out of the balanced Renaissance framework and favour innovative formal solutions with a powerful, dramatic charge. In 1524, he moved to Rome, where the exasperated expressive research of his previous years gave way to a sophisticated, intellectual formal elegance. Following the Sack of Rome in 1527, he travelled around many Italian cities, eventually reaching France. There, he secured a position at the court of King Francis I, who commissioned him to decorate the palace in Fontainebleau, the Gallery of which would become a cornerstone of international Mannerism. Carthusian monk Leonardo Buonafede, prior of the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova, commissioned him to execute this painting in 1518, to honour the testamentary bequest of Francesca de\u2019 Ripoi, a Catalan widow who had died in Florence the previous year. The large altarpiece was to be positioned above an altar of the Ognissanti Church, where the widow had been buried. According to the commissioning contract, the painting was supposed to depict the Virgin and Child among the saints John the Baptist, Benedict (who shared the same name as the widow\u2019s father), Leonard (who shared the commissioner\u2019s name) and Jerome. The painter undertook to deliver the work by the end of June that same year, but when it was completed, the commissioner voiced his dissatisfaction for the result and the work was relegated to the church of Santo Stefano in Grezzano. Vasari relates that Leonardo Buonafede deemed the altarpiece \u201csketchy\u201d and complained about the bizarre unseemliness of the saints, who resembled \u201ccruel, desperate\u201d devils. The dispute between painter and commissioner also had legal consequences, since Rosso Fiorentino took Buonafede to court for withholding nine florins from the twenty-five they had negotiated as payment. The fact that the painting was put to a different use also explains its divergence from the initial iconography. And in fact, the studies carried out on the work have revealed the existence of a previous version beneath the one visible today. St Leonard was transformed into St Stephen, after whom the church in Grezzano was named, and the saint\u2019s attributes were changed accordingly, replacing Leonard\u2019s shackles with the stone on Stephen\u2019s forehead. Instead, St Benedict was changed into St Anthony the Abbot, and the mark of the Tau was added to his monk\u2019s habit. The other two saints at the sides of the composition are St John the Baptist and St Jerome, who shared the experience of penitence in the desert. Buonafede\u2019s criticism of the painting reverberates in the figure of St Jerome, whose skeletal body, emaciated and scowling face and grasping hands embody the restless and anti-classical spirit of the painter\u2019s early phase.

The triptych, depicting the Raising of Lazarus, Froment\u2019s oldest known work to date, was painted for a prelate from Prato named Francesco Coppini who lived in Flanders, England and France from 1459 to 1462, performing various tasks for Pope Pius II Piccolomini. The realistic portrait on the back of the right-hand panel of the triptych reveals the features of this enterprising, cultured and ambitious prelate. Born into a humble Prato family in 1402, Francesco embarked on a career in the Church and became a skilled lawyer, whilst also earning recognition for his diplomatic talents. Appointed Bishop of Terni in 1458, he was sent by Pope Pius II to Flanders and to France the following year to collect \"Peter\u2019s pence\", after which he travelled to England in an effort to broker peace between the Houses of York and Lancaster. Coppini\u2019s support for King Edward IV of the House of York, who was crowned in 1461 after deposing King Henry VI of the House of Lancaster, was disapproved of by the pope who recalled Coppini to Rome and stripped him of his bishopric and his assets in 1463. Coppini donned the Benedictine habit and spent the last few months of his life in the monastery of St. Paul\u2019s Without the Walls, outside Rome, where he died in 1464. Coppini was stripped of his titles and his assets were confiscated. The triptych probably came  into the ownership of the Medici family and was subsequently donated to the Franciscan convent of Bosco ai Frati, where it remained until the convent was suppressed under Napoleon. It entered the Uffizi in 1841. Influenced by Flemish painting, Nicolas Froment tends to characterise his figures\u2019 features almost to the point of caricature.

Finding inspiration in episodes taken from classical mythology and Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, Borghini had developed a series of \u201cinventions\u201d laced with complicated allegorical meanings designed to celebrate the Florentine \u201ctalents\u201d and the great Medici governance. Francesco I, who had an introverted and contemplative temperament, was particularly fond of this genre of painting destined for private use: in fact, only a few very cultured people were capable of understanding its symbolic, often obscure meanings. Here, it is important to remember that Borghini would also go on to devise the complicated iconographic plan of the studiolo that the prince commissioned in Palazzo Vecchio a few years later, to which Allori also contributed, with the paintings Pearl fishing and Banquet of Cleopatra. This small work depicts Hercules crowned by the nine Muses, a tribute to him for having rescued them from the Giants, who are lying on the ground, defeated. Beside the hero, the figure of Calliope, the patron of epic poetry, stands out. She is holding a tablet bearing an inscription that invites Hercules to reap the praise and accolades for his feats. The background features a temple dedicated to Honour and Fame. The painting therefore aims to reference the condition of peace achieved by Florence thanks to the great Medici governance, under which the arts were protected and allowed them to flourish. From a stylistic point of view, the work is undoubtedly tinged by the influence of Bronzino, Allori\u2019s teacher, upon whose death Allori would inherit his workshop and his role as official artist of the Medici court. Allori\u2019s gratitude to his teacher is particularly evident in the pale, smooth complexion of the muse Calliope, and in her refined curly hairstyle, interlaced with strings of pearls.

The self-portrait is a pictorial genre that returns repeatedly in Cai Guo Qiang's work, because it is closely in tune with his conception of art as a continuous challenge and adventure, and the artist as a kind of shaman who frees and attempts to dominate invisible energies.

Furthermore, this tondo is one of the first known works which depicts the Holy Family in a landscape, and it served as a model for a whole generation of artists, from Michelangelo and his Tondo Doni, to Raphael and Andrea del Sarto. In fact, the monumental rendering of the figures, placed in the foreground and almost invading the physical world, is certainly the most characteristic feature of the painting, a detail that differs from the works of his youth and seems to anticipate 16th-century techniques. The Virgin, characterized by a pearly complexion and wide red tunic, is intent on reading a book, while Christ turns his gaze to St. Joseph. The three subjects in their monumentality occupy the whole painted space; on the background, we can see a barely defined desert or country landscape and some figures heading towards the fortifications. As far as dating is concerned, scholars lean towards the second half of the 1480s, placing the work in a moment just before the realization of his paintings for Siena, where the painter arrived in the following decade.

Giuseppe Maria Crespi, a painter of Bolognese origin, was particularly popular with the Grand Prince Ferdinand, whom he loved to depict on holiday, staying at his villa in Poggio a Caiano, the temporary home to a small, refined court, which also counted artists among its members."}, {"title": "The alms of St Nicholas; St Nicholas ordained as bishop of Myra", "artist": "Ambrogio Lorenzetti", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1597076430007832/6.AL.san-Nicola1.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "In the scene at the top, St Nicholas is busy throwing some pieces of gold to a poor man to enable him to gather the dowry required to marry off his daughters. The alms of St Nicholas is an exemplary act: he carries out the charitable deed secretly, humbly, without seeking acknowledgement. In the scene at the bottom, St Nicholas is ordained as bishop of the city of Myra in Asia Minor, by divine will. Legend has it that the prelates who had gathered to elect the new bishop of Myra heard a voice ordering them to choose the first man named Nicholas who entered the church. The scene shows the saint twice, once in the foreground on the right, dressed in pink at the entrance to the church, as a prelate approaches him, and then kneeling in the presbytery before the altar, where he is ordained as priest and bishop. The panel is the first part of a cycle featuring four stories of the legend of St Nicholas (see also inv. 1890 no. 8349 ), the overall structure of which still remains a source of mystery today. The presence of hinge-like elements along one of the two sides of both panels suggests that they were the side elements of a reredos probably featuring the figure of the saint in the centre. Having come to the Florentine Gallery from the Benedictine abbey of Santa Maria in Florence at the beginning of the 19th century, the panels were originally part of the furnishings in a nearby church named after St Procolo. They are an outstanding testimony of the activity of Siena-born painter Ambrogio Lorenzetti who, like his brother Pietro, worked for various Florentine customers. In addition to his extraordinary storytelling talent, in these exceptional works, the painter also displays his passion for complex spatial orchestrations and his great skill in depicting architectures.

The Greek poet Hesiod, in his poem Theogony, recalls their names: Euphrosyne (Joy), Aglaea (Radiance), and Thalia (Prosperity). In line with the traditional iconography of Greek-Roman origin, Poppi depicts them nude, according to the classical custom that saw the female nude as the representation of ideal beauty which has no need for ornaments. The three women are standing in a circle. The central figure has her back turned and the other two are facing the spectator. They are clasping hands with one another in a sort of dance that symbolises the circular harmony of friendship. Francesco Morandini, known as Poppi, a student of Vasari\u2019s, belonged to the circle of artists active at the Medici court in the sophisticated intellectual circle that had formed around Francesco I de' Medici and scholar Don Vincenzo Borghini in the early 1570s. One of the paintings created by Poppi for Francesco features a portrayal of the Golden age: The subject was part of a series of \u201cinventions\u201d that Borghini had developed, based on episodes taken from classical mythology and Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, designed to celebrate the Florentine \u201ctalents\u201d and the great Medici governance. Poppi was also one of the artists appointed to translate into painting the complicated iconographic plan developed by Borghini for Francesco\u2019s Studiolo in Palazzo Vecchio, under Vasari\u2019s supervision, between 1570 and 1572. This oil painting on copper is therefore part of the category of those small works with a mythological theme, destined for private use, particularly appreciated by Francesco and his court. From a stylistic point of view, the work is strongly influenced by the \u2018monumentalism\u2019 of Michelangelo, but this is mellowed by the soft, round features, expressed in the characteristic elegant, sophisticated poses of Poppi\u2019s style."}, {"title": "Madonna and Child", "artist": "Master of San Torp\u00e8", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1657115115609504/2.Maestro-di-San-Torp-.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The central panel of a polyptych, this painting depicts the Virgin and the Baby Jesus according to the Odigitria Byzantine model, that is, she who shows the way to salvation.

His legs are crossed, an approach that connotes him as a judge, and he shows the heel of his bare foot, possibly alluding to the foot that will step on the devil (Genesis, 3:13-15). This panel came to the Uffizi in 1989 with a group of works illegally exported from Italy and recovered after 1945 by Rodolfo Siviero. An inscription on the back states that on 26 May 1843, the sacred image was blessed by Giovanni Battista Bitossi, vicar general of the Diocese of Volterra, and that it was displayed in the chapel of Sant\u2019Andrea at the Conservatorio di San Pietro in Volterra between the Feast of Ascension and the Feast of Pentecost, that is, from 25 May to 4 June 1843. The origin of the work could, however, be different. The panel with the Madonna and Child may in fact have been the centrepiece of a polyptych alongside two panels featuring Saints Paul and John the Evangelist, preserved in the National Museum of San Matteo in Pisa (inv. nos. 1670 and 1672), which bear the Cinquini coat of arms, a family from Pisa. The polyptych may therefore have been executed for the chapel named after the Apostles, whose patronage the family had San Francesco church in Pisa. The work is assumed to be by a master who was active in Pisa but of Sienese culture, trained under the influence of Duccio di Boninsegna. The formal name by which he is known, the Master of San Torp\u00e8, derives from the name of a church in Pisa where one of his paintings was kept.

The origin of the reredos is unknown, and there is no room for speculation, since no attributes allow us to identify the saints alongside the Virgin and Child. The inscriptions with names placed in the gold base of each panel have also been lost, although the initial letters, \u201cS\u201d (Sanctus) remain.

The building, which still exists today, was incorporated by Vasari into the architectural structure of the Uffizi. The painting is one of the oldest known works by Cosimo Rosselli, who was trained in the workshop of Neri di Bicci, where he spent three years, from 1453 to 1456. Like his master, the artist prefers traditional and consolidated models in the artistic repertoire of the time: the curtains of cloth that \u201copen\u201d the scene, already widely used by Alessio Baldovinetti; the marble floor derives from the one painted by Pollaiolo for the Pala del Cardinale del Portogallo in San Miniato al Monte, a few years earlier (and now in the Uffizi); the standing Child recalls the marble reliefs by Desiderio da Settignano. In the construction of the sacred scene, the perspective converges strongly towards the centre, accentuated by the figures in the foreground placed in three-quarters and by the pillars of the throne, which squeeze towards the bottom. The figure of Mary emerges clear and bright, affectionately holding the Child to herself, while with a thoughtful and melancholy look she seems to foresee the future. To the left of the viewer is Nicholas, the saint who lived in Lycia and was elected bishop in 300 AD, whose relics arrived in Bari in 1087. He is identified by the three golden balls he holds in his right hand, representing the act of mercy he performed: the donation of a bag of gold coins to a man who could not afford to make a dowry for his three daughters. On the right is St. Anthony Abbot, the famous hermit of the Church, who was born in and lived in Egypt, here represented with a long beard (he died over a hundred years old in 353 AD), with a tau-shaped stick (sign of Christian devotion, last letter of the Hebrew alphabet and representation of the cross) and a small pig. This typical attribute of the Saint is connected to various traditions, one of which would see the use of the fat of the animal as a remedy for shingles, also known as St. Anthony's fire: the saint was also venerated as protector of this disease. Cosimo Rosselli had excellent entrepreneurial skills and, like his master, was at the head of a large workshop of artists, thanks to which he was able to diversify his commissions: from panels, to wall paintings, to the realisation of apparatuses and more. Under him were formed for example Piero di Cosimo and Baccio della Porta. The work came into the grand-ducal collections following the suppression of ecclesiastical institutions promoted by Pietro Leopoldo of Lorraine in 1784."}, {"title": "Madonna and Child Enthroned between Saint Martin of Tours and Saint Dorothy (or Rosalie)", "artist": "Benvenuto Tisi, known as Garofalo", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1632834778899124/5.Garofalo.-Madonna-col-Bambino-e-santi.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Painted by Garofalo in his younger years for the parish church of San Martino di Codigoro (Ferrara), the large altarpiece has the figure of the Virgin at its centre, seated on a majestic throne set in a bucolic landscape. Mary is intent on supporting the infant Jesus on her legs, whose blessing pose mirrors image of Adam painted in grisaille in the cameo at the base of the throne, depicting the creation of man by God the Father. The theological connection established between the two is immediate: Jesus, through the sacrifice of his own life, redeems humanity from sin by becoming the \"new Adam\". The scene is completed, at the sides of the throne, by two elegant figures: on the left is Saint Martin, a noble knight of the Roman imperial guard, about to share his cloak with a poor man prostrate at his feet; on the right, instead, is a saint, otherwise identified as Dorothea or Rosalie, accompanied by a small basket of roses, which also crown her head. The dates and circumstances of Garofalo's commission are not known, but critics are unanimous in recognising in the general layout of the painting a full adherence to the classicism of the central Italian area, characterised by relaxed and serene rhythms. In particular, the well-balanced formal balance of the altarpiece and the courtly tones, pervaded by a graceful sweetness, show Garofalo's knowledge of the painting of Lorenzo Costa, the last exponent of the great Ferrarese painters of the late 1400s who were still active in Ferrara, Bologna and Mantua in the early 1500s. The slow, almost dilated rhythm of the atmosphere can be compared to the manner of Perugino and the experiments of the young Raphael, while in some passages, such as the small scene in the distance and the balustrade that divides the sacred world from the profane, the first contributions of Giorgione's painting can be seen (Pala di Castelfranco).

At the sides of the throne, two angels - their wings are not visible - devoutly offer a pyx and a crown, ornaments that also characterise the saints Mary Magdalene and Catherine of Alexandria, with whom the two figures, dressed in red, have sometimes been identified. Below, other angels offer vases full of flowers to the Virgin and Child and scatter incense with thuribles, a motif inspired by one of the most venerated Marian images in Florence, Bernardo Daddi's painting of the tabernacle in Orsanmichele. As the inscription states, the panel was commissioned by Giovanni Segni to atone for his own sins and those of his ancestors for the chapel the family patronised in the church of San Lucchese in Poggibonsi (Siena). The coat of arms of the house is depicted in the centre of the throne step. Because of the presence of the name of the author and the date in the inscription, the panel is a milestone in the career of Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto's pupil who, having survived the terrible epidemic of the Black Death, became the most authoritative representative of Giotto's tradition after the mid-14th century. The homage to Giotto is evident in this image, which takes up the model of the Majesty of All Saints (Uffizi) in its composition and in many details, although made more sumptuous by the decorative richness, as shown by the Virgin's dress, adorned with the letters S and M (Santa Maria). The work is also a demonstration of the mastery achieved by many 14th-century painters in working with gold and silver leaf, used not only for the background and the halos, but also for the decoration of the robes, the throne and the material rendering of the furnishings.

In this case they are identifiable, thanks also to the names inscribed in gold letters on the parapet, of the two closest to the Virgin, most likely executed by the painter's brother, Davide: these are Dionysius the Areopagite, the saint converted to Christianity by the preaching of St. Paul, and Thomas Aquinas, recognisable by the rayed sun on his chest, his attribute and symbol of sacred wisdom. Theologian, philosopher and academic, exponent of the philosophical current called Scolastica, St. Thomas shows the Summa Theologiae, his most famous text. Kneeling in the foreground, almost with his back turned towards the Madonna and Child, is Dominic, the founder of the Order of Preachers, wearing the typical black cloak: his presence in the painting is further proof of its original location in the Dominican church of San Marco in Florence. On the right, also kneeling, is Pope Clement I who, as befits his role, wears a very elegant cope, of red damask silk with an embroidery on the back shield depicting \u201cMoses with the tablets of the law\u201d. St. Clement also as St. Dominic is turning his back, but with a penetrating gaze towards the spectator, and indicates the Saviour with his left hand, almost as if he wanted to invite us to participate in the holy conversation, making himself the mediator between the real world and the divine. Equipped with an excellent technique, a lively palette and a great narrative clarity, Ghirlandaio knows how to combine in his works the Florentine artistic tradition, based on drawing and the study of perspective, with the innovation in colour and analytical description of nature introduced by the Flemish painting, very much in vogue in Florence in the last decades of the 15th century. This explains, also in this altarpiece, the subtlety and precision with which the precious fabrics are described, the brightness of the gems and golds, the Anatolian carpet on which the feet of the Virgin rest, the shiny silver vases resting on the balustrade and finally the natural elements, the plants: roses, Mary's flowers; orange and lilies, symbols of virginal purity; finally the pomegranate, in this case allegory of the Church, which welcomes and protects the faithful like grains in the skin of the fruit."}, {"title": "Madonna and Child enthroned with Saints Jerome and John the Baptist, two angels, and two children from the Pazzi family", "artist": "Andrea del Castagno", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1581604705945635-Andrea-delCastagno_MadonnaPazzi.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "At the top, two angels are holding a cloth of honour behind Mary, seated on the throne with her Son.

The boy is wearing a collar with a sail-shaped pendant, which alludes to the fortune granted to the Pazzi family by French king Ren\u00e9 of Anjou in 1442. The polychrome marble tiles on the floor, the carpet covering the steps, and the glimpse of the two angels in flight show the expertise achieved by Andrea del Castagno in terms of perspective, while the statuary quality of the figures reflects the artist\u2019s attention to the sculptural work of Donatello.

He trained in direct contact with Correggio who, at the time, was painting the large cycles of frescoes in the churches of Parma. After completing his first commissions in Parma, Parmigianino finished his training in Rome, where he studied the works of Michelangelo and Raphael. His intellectual, eccentric temperament drove him to develop an elegant, sophisticated, anti-classic style that made him the leading figure of Emilian Mannerism. He was commissioned to paint the Madonna with the long neck in 1534 by Elena Baiardi Tagliaferri for the church of Santa Maria dei Servi in Parma. In the commissioning contract, the artist undertook to finish the painting in five months, but when he died in 1540, the altarpiece was in his study, still unfinished. Two years later, a decision was made to place it on the altar for which it had been destined, and the following inscription was added to the base of the column to justify its incomplete state: \u201cAdverse destiny prevented Francesco Mazzola from Parma from completing this work\u201d. A Virgin with a statuesque figure reminiscent of Michelangelo, but with unnaturally elongated forms, contemplates the Divine Infant, who is asleep on her lap. The Child\u2019s slumber prefigures his death on the cross, as the image of the Crucifixion is reflected in the urn that the angel is showing to the Virgin. The column on Mary\u2019s left highlights the suppleness of her bust and neck, but it could also be a reference to the incorruptible purity of the Virgin sung about in the Marian hymn Collum tuum ut columna: \u201cYour neck is like a column\u201d. The small figure at the bottom on the right is St Jerome, who is unrolling his scroll as he turns towards an unfinished figure, St Francis (the artist only had time to paint one of his feet). The presence of St Francis could be a reference to the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, the cult of which was diffused by the Franciscan order. Although depicting a sacred theme, the artist does not forgo the typical sensuality of his artistic production: the figures with elongated limbs and refined poses, interpreted with sophisticated elegance, are permeated by a subtle eroticism, perceivable in the drapery clinging to the Virgin\u2019s body, highlighting her curves, in the slender hand lifted to the breast, in the litheness of the naked leg of the young angel in the foreground. Joining the Medici collections in 1698, the painting is part of an altarpiece that the Grand Prince Ferdinando had purchased to increase his collection of masterpieces from the Renaissance to the early 17th century.

The creative process of the panel, conceived within an unusual architectural structure, must have featured a continuing redefinition of its composition throughout the work itself. In fact, from close up, it is possible to see many pentimenti. The most plausible theory as to the hitherto unknown origins of the work is in fact a recent one. It may have arrived at the Trivulzio family, passing through various hands, from the church of the Santissima Annunciata convent in Lacchiarella (Milan), a Franciscan convent of friars from the Amadeiti congregation, known as San Martino. This ownership may help to identify the characters around the Virgin: the young bearded man in the white shirt and ample green tunic, who is looking at the Child may be the artist\u2019s patron, perhaps Giovanni del Conte, member of a family with close ties to the convent, who made a bequest in 1513. The figure with the very long sword, on the right, instead of St Paul, as thought previously, could be St Martin of Tours, joined here by the poor man in the foreground, in the process of adoring the Madonna, his back facing the onlooker. To the left is a kneeling St John the Baptist, who faces the onlooker: a presence that may be a reference to the customer. Behind Mary, on the left is St Ambrose holding his scourge and crozier. In a previous version, the saint was painted with his bishop\u2019s mitre, later eliminated. To the left of the Child is the white-bearded St Jerome, painted in the act of striking his bare chest with a stone, as a sign of penitence. There is also perhaps a St Joseph, with his hands folded over his chest. The altar piece is among one of the most successful by this painter, who developed his own very personal style after training in Milan with Urbino architect and painter, Donato Bramante. Style comparisons place the work among the later pieces by Bramantino, dating back to the first half the 1520s, coming as it does a few years after the Madonna and Child with Two Angels, now in Brera, painted by the artist shortly after his return from Rome in 1508."}, {"title": "Madonna and Child with Saints Peter and Paul", "artist": "Ugolino di Nerio and Bartolomeo Bulgarini", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1631096136938785/8.-Ugolino-di-nerio.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Fragmentary inscriptions on the frame identify the saints on either side of the Madonna and Child.

The Virgin is seated on a throne, of which it is possible to glimpse only the soft, embroidered cushion and the carved arm. She is intently gazing at her son, turning towards him with hands clasped in prayer. Her expression is gentle and indulgent, almost melancholy, as if she can foresee the painful destiny that awaits her son. The young Jesus, covered only in swaddling, looks back at Mary, holding both arms out to her, supported by two angels. The angel in the foreground is smiling and looking outwards, as if to bring the onlooker into the scene. The close-up style, with the group painted as little more than half figures, placed in a small space and bordered by a Serena stone frame, make this composition similar to numerous relief sculptures made by the Florentine sculptors of the same period. The window opens out onto a vast, varied landscape, overlooking the sea, with rocks, vegetation, and buildings. The holy image has been translated with a deep sense of humanity, both through the expression of affections and in the choice of clothes and hairstyles, which have been inspired by the fashions of the same period. The Virgin is dressed most elegantly, with a crown of pearls and veils woven into her hair, in the same way as Florentine noblewomen from the late 15th century. The halos are barely hinted at: fine crowns and rays of light that do not cover the landscape behind. As yet there is nothing to confirm the idea that the Virgin\u2019s face is none other than that of Lucrezia Buti, the young nun from Prato, who went on to become Lippi\u2019s wife. The composition was a success from the start, and used as a model by many artists, including the young Botticelli, a pupil of the artist. We do not know, however, the original destination of this holy image; the first information dates back to the late 18th century, when it was in the Medici Villa of Poggio Imperiale in Florence."}, {"title": "Virgin and Child", "artist": "Ugolino di Nerio", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1631100686650957/19.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The usual theme of the Madonna and Child is characterised here by an intimate dialogue between mother and child, which is emphasised by Jesus\u2019 posture, who grasps the veil worn under Mary's mantle with both hands.

Mary's veil heralds the shroud with which Christ's body will be wrapped after his descent from the cross. This work was the central panel of an altarpiece. In the past, the work has been attributed to Duccio di Buoninsegna, the founder of the fourteenth-century Sienese school of painting, but is more likely to be the work of one of his close followers and collaborators: Ugolino di Nerio. Ugolino was perhaps the most faithful interpreter of the Duchy's artistic style, whose sophisticated elegance he often accentuated. Although little about his life is revealed in documents and sources, Ugolino must have possessed good business skills as he achieved considerable fame outside of Siena, so much so that he received commissions for the altarpieces of two of the most important churches in Florence: Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce. The panel, which belongs to the Contini Bonacossi Collection, possesses features of Ugolino\u2019s earlier works, namely the full-centred arch frame, which was gradually replaced by a Gothic arch, and the gold leaf decoration on the halos, which appears to have been applied by hand rather than with a punching tool, as Ugolini was wont to do in his later years.

Initially the panels were attributed to Florentine painter Giovanni di Francesco del Cervelliera by Giovannozzi, but their paternity has been the subject of lengthy discussions by art historians and critics.  More recent studies have brought some clarity with regard to the identity of the artist, and the most accredited theory would seem to split the figure of Giovanni into two artists of the same name: Giovanni di Francesco del Cervelliera and Giovanni di Francesco (Franco) di Piero. The latter, born in 1425-1426 and documented until 1498, is thought to be the artist of the so-called Carrand Triptych, now in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence, as well as of the work described here. The Madonna with Child is therefore counted among the later works of Giovanni di Franco, realized between 1454 and 1459, which represent the peak of the activity of this pupil of Andrea del Castagno. The solid composition and monumentality of shapes show evident influences of Castagno, while the expressiveness of the palette, consisting in vivid and enamelled colours, is reminiscent of the Florentine movement known as the \u201cpainters of light\u201d, of which Giovanni di Franco was one of the main exponents.

The artist has focused  on the fingers clenching the small bunch of flowers that animates the scene, causing baby Jesus to laugh joyfully.

This is an ancient iconography of Byzantine origin, the Glykophilousa, which again rose to success among the Florentine artists of the 15th Century. Mary appears thoughtful, anticipating the painful destiny awaiting her child. The two figures are placed within a Renaissance architecture that opens up on the background, a lodge, from which the painting takes its name. This work can be dated to Botticelli\u2019s early years, as suggested by the references to Filippo Lippi\u2019s style. Having attended the workshop of a goldsmith at a very young age, Botticelli completed his painting apprenticeship in Lippi\u2019s studio.  Botticelli left Lippi\u2019s studio around 1467, at the same time as when Filippo moved to Spoleto and he probably grew close to Andrea Verrocchio, the other great master who had a strong influence on his training; the Madonna della Loggia was painted in this moment of his life. The image expresses the natural sentiment a mother has for her child and radiates a sense of tender intimacy. On the other hand, the composition is a reference to the Madonna with Child painted by Filippo Lippi around 1460 in Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence, which had in turn been inspired by the interpretations of the theme shared by sculptors such as Lorenzo Ghiberti, Donatello and Luca della Robbia, using a variety of materials, especially clay, marble and stucco. However, Botticelli refers to Flemish painting for the environment: his figures are set in front of a lodge that opens up on to a rural landscape portrayed in minute detail Unfortunately, this part of the painting appears to be ruined, despite its restoration in 2004, which also confirmed its authenticity. Previously Botticelli\u2019s signature had been doubted due to its mediocre state of conservation. The work, which is likely to have originally been set in a tabernacle frame, could be one of the so-called \u201ccolmi da camera\u201d destined for private religious devotion, which Botticelli worked on before receiving more challenging commissions.  One theory about the commissioning of the Madonna della Loggia is offered by its provenance. In fact, the painting was given to the Uffizi Gallery by the Chamber of Commerce and Arts in 1784. This institution had absorbed the functions and confiscated the properties of the ancient trade guilds, known as the Arts, and of the Court of Mercanzia.

The saints are much smaller than the figures in the central panel. The various parts differ in terms of conservation, shape and even the proportions of the arches and decorations on the haloes. The altarpiece is, in fact, the result of a modern assembly of two separate works by Agnolo Gaddi, a major exponent of Late Gothic painting in Florence.

The saint holding a crozier is perhaps the founder of western monasticism, Benedict. Under his cope, he wears a white tunic, identical to those worn by the Olivetan Benedictine monks who lived in the Florentine monastery from 1373. The apostle Peter, next to St Benedict, is holding a book, inscribed with a phrase from the Last Supper: DOMINE TECUM PARATUS SUM ET IN CARCEREM ET IN MORTEM IRE (Lk, 22:33; And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death).

The scene of the Annunciation presents iconographic characteristics inspired by the apocryphal Gospels of James and Matthew: as related therein, the archangel Gabriel appeared to Mary in her home while she was spinning purple and scarlet yarn for weaving a curtain for the temple. This is why the Virgin is in the painting is holding spinning tools, namely spindle and distaff.

Both saints wear robes typically associated with the two orders. Saint Francis, whose hands and feet are marked by stigmata, wears a brown habit, while Saint Dominic wears a white tunic under a black cloak.

The Assisian saint takes the place of honour to the right of Mary and Jesus. The throne is depicted using oblique projection. This technique was used by painters in the second half of the thirteenth century to depict three-dimensionality and to create depth. The material concreteness of the throne is emphasised by the two angels resting their hands on its back. The painting is attributed to Cimabue, a painter also mentioned in Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. Cimabue helped guide painting towards naturalism, paving the way for his pupil, Giotto. However, there is no consensus on this attribution \u2013 which is also hindered by the painting\u2019s poor state of conservation. The work could therefore be attributed to one of Cimabue\u2019s collaborators or followers, perhaps the painter of the frescoes of St. Michael in the Velluti Chapel in the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence.

On her knees sits the Christ Child, dressed in traditional ancient robes, with a rich red cloth, woven with gold, around his hips. He is giving a blessing with his right hand. The throne is being held by six kneeling angels who seem to be suspended in the void, giving the impressions that this is a sudden apparition of the holy image before the worshippers.

Seated on a grand, imposing ivory throne, with an articulated architectural form, the Virgin Mary is using her right hand to point to her son, whom she is holding, according to the Byzantine model of the Virgin Hodegetria, i.e. he who shows the way to salvation. Dressed like a philosopher from ancient times, Jesus is blessing and holding a rolled scroll, which is perhaps the scroll of the Law. The clothes worn by Mary and her son feature a precious golden decoration known as damascene, a characteristic of traditional Byzantine painting, which was greatly fashionable in Italian medieval painting. Around them are eight angels with splendid multi-coloured wings, gently raising the throne.

He trained in direct contact with Correggio who, at the time, was painting the large cycles of frescoes in the churches of Parma. After completing his first commissions in Parma, he finished his training in Rome, where he studied the works of Michelangelo and Raphael. His intellectual, eccentric temperament drove him to develop an elegant, sophisticated, anti-classic style that made him the leading figure of Emilian Mannerism. His Madonna with St Zachariah dates to the early 1530s, when the artist, who had fled after the Sack of Rome 1527, was staying in Bologna for a few years, focusing on an intense production of altarpieces and paintings for private devotion like this one, commissioned by Count Bonifacio Gozzadini from Bologna. The painting is named after the saint portrayed in the foreground. The stern gaze of the priest, father of John the Baptist, guides the beholder towards the Virgin, who is sitting down with the Child in her arms. Baby Jesus, with his large languid, thoughtful eyes, is held tight by John the Baptist, whose tanned complexion is in stark contrast with the pale skin of the Messiah. John the Baptist is bending over to give his cousin a tender kiss, which he returns, caressing his cheek. On the left, a sensual Mary Magdalene, her breast barely concealed by her long blonde flowing hair, shows the vase of anointing oils, her traditional attribute. In the background, an arch of triumph and a large spiral column appear, recollections of the artist\u2019s stay in Rome, and symbols of paganism in ruins. However, the column could also be a reference to the incorruptible purity of the Virgin, sung about in the Marian hymn Collum tuum ut columna: \u201cYour neck is like a column\u201d, symbolism that the artist would further develop a few years later in his famous Madonna with the Long Neck. The heavy book held by St Zachariah in his left arm may be the key to interpreting the meaning of the work, which refers to St John as the precursor of the Messiah. The powerful muscle structure of St Zachariah\u2019s arm shows the influence of Michelangelo\u2019s Roman frescoes. The fragmented wording visible on the book is indeed taken from a passage of Luke\u2019s gospel (1:68) in which St Zachariah, when naming his son John, regains the power of speech and immediately recognises his son as a prophet: \u201cAnd you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways\u201d. From a stylistic perspective, the painting is still influenced by Correggio, in terms of the tender gestures exchanged between Jesus and St John, and the poetic landscape in the background, but the serene gentleness that pervades the master\u2019s work here gives way to a subtle sense of restlessness and a vague eroticism that give the holy scene an intangible mysterious vein, characteristic of many of Parmigianino\u2019s works."}, {"title": "Virgin and Child between St Francis of Assisi and St John the Evangelist ('Madonna of the Harpies')", "artist": "Andrea d'Agnolo, known as Andrea del Sarto", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1588091757516528-1.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Giorgio Vasari, who frequented Andrea del Sarto\u2019s studio as a young man, defined him as \u201cthe flawless painter\u201d. His style, shaped by his studies of the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, and characterised by an exquisitely balanced composition and high level of formal control, strongly influenced 16th Florentine painting, to such an extent that it was considered a precursor of Mannerism. Del Sarto was commissioned to execute this painting for the nuns of the convent of St Francis de\u2019Macci. Within its solid and meticulous compositional structure, the artist almost seamlessly combines the typical pyramidal shape of the Virgins painted by Raphael with the statuesque feel of the figures created by Michelangelo, mellowing them with the delicate, shaded colours of Da Vinci. The traditional title of the painting was coined based on Vasari\u2019s identification of the monsters depicted on the Virgin\u2019s pedestal as harpies. However, based on an iconographic interpretation of the work, which assigns an eschatological symbolism to the subject, today critics mostly agree that they depict the locusts described in St John the Evangelist\u2019s Apocalypse. And, in fact, here St John is portrayed beside the Virgin, writing his prophecies. In the ninth chapter of the work, he announces that these monstrous beings, with women\u2019s heads and bellies resembling iron breastplates, are said to have emerged from the well of the abyss in a cloud of smoke, effectively visible on Mary\u2019s right, bringing torment to all human beings who did not bear the tau, God\u2019s seal, on their foreheads. This interpretation could also explain the presence of St Francis in place of San Bonaventura, who had been supposed to feature in the work, as confirmed in the commissioning contract for the painting. And indeed Bonaventura, in his Legenda Maior, identifies in St Francis the angel of the sixth seal prophesied by John. Rising up towards the East, he is believed to have taken with him the salvific symbol of God, the tau, the cross that is the emblem of the Passion of Christ, imprinted on him, in the form of his stigmata. According to this interpretation, the pedestal the Virgin is sitting on represents the well of Hell and the Virgin is closing its mouth. This complex religious symbolism is thought to have been developed by Antonio di Ludovico Sassolini, the \u201cbrother of Santa Croce of the Order of Friars Minor\u201d who, according to Vasari, had commissioned the painting. Sassolini, then Minister of the Conventual Franciscans of Tuscany, had in fact been an avid fan of the sermons of Savonarola and was one of the figures responsible for stoking the climate of religious fervour that reigned in Florence during those early decades of the 16th century. Joining the Medici collections around 1704, the Madonna of the Harpies was the last altarpiece removed from the churches in Tuscany by Ferdinando de' Medici to increase his own collection of Renaissance and early 17th century masterpieces. In exchange for the painting, which had decorated the main altar of their church for almost two centuries, the nuns of the convent of St Francis de\u2019Macci requested that Ferdinando restore the convent and church. The Grand Prince of Tuscany, who had been eager to obtain the altarpiece by Del Sarto since 1683, willingly accepted their condition, commissioning Giovan Battista Foggini, architect of the Grand Duchy, to complete the task."}, {"title": "Madonna of Humility", "artist": "Tommaso di Cristofano Fini, known as Masolino", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1575380533783038-14.madonna-dell-umilt-.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Mary is seated upon a cushion on the ground, following the iconographic  model known as the Madonna of Humility (from the Latin humus, ground).

Both models emphasize Mary\u2019s privileged role as intermediary between God and humanity. This subject seems particularly suited to a holy image displayed in worship and destined to a small oratory or the secondary altar of a church, as the small size of Masolino\u2019s painting would seem to suggest. The right side of the panel is damaged, where the support shows a modern addition at the top, and there is extensive reapplication on the gold background and painted surface. In spite of this, the image of the Madonna and Child is clear overall, characterized by the fluid progression of the clothing, in late Gothic style and the softness of the tender skin. The majority of scholars attribute the painting to Masolino, of whom this Madonna of Humility would be one of the oldest works known to date. The origins of the work are not known.

Some of the works that best represent this style include \u201cThe Butcher\u2019s Shop\u201d or \u201cThe Bean Eater\u201d. Annibale, together with his brother Agostino, and cousin, Ludovico, made a bold impression on the artistic developments of Bolognese and later, Italian painting, forging a classical and at the same time, naturalist ideal. In 1582, Annibale and Agostino founded the Academy known as the \u201cAccademia degli Incamminati\u201d in Bologna, with the aim of taking painting out of the anguished tones of Mannerism, following the example of the great Masters of the 16th century, and placing the focus on anatomy and life drawing. According to some critics, the  Man with a Monkey may be a work by Titian or Tintoretto, considering the use of colour that reflects the Veneto style and setting. What is not up for debate is the extraordinary quality and inventive freshness of the portrait, showing how a profound shift was taking place towards the end of the 16th century, moving away from a cultured, intellectual form of painting, in the Mannerist style towards a freer approach that was more open to unusual, popular subjects. These are the premises for the birth of Caravaggio\u2019s style of painting and to the spread of genre art that looked more towards a composite vision of everyday reality."}, {"title": "Moses Defends the Daughters of Jethro", "artist": "Giovanni Battista di Jacopo, known as Rosso Fiorentino", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1592577068833488/2.Rosso-mos-.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Giovanni Battista di Jacopo, nicknamed Rosso Fiorentino (\u201crosso\u201d means red) due to the colour of his hair, trained in the workshop of Andrea del Sarto alongside his peer, Pontormo. From his early Florentine works, he displayed a particularly original style, characterised by a strong anti-classical energy, which tended to break out of the balanced Renaissance framework and favour innovative formal solutions with a powerful, dramatic charge. In 1524, he moved to Rome, where the exasperated expressive research of his previous years gave way to a sophisticated, intellectual formal elegance. Following the Sack of Rome in 1527, he travelled around many Italian cities, eventually reaching France. There, he secured a position at the court of King Francis I, who commissioned him to decorate the palace in Fontainebleau, the Gallery of which would become a cornerstone of international Mannerism. In Rosso\u2019s biography, Vasari describes \u201ca painting of several beautiful nude figures, in a story of Moses when he kills the Egyptian, depicting highly commendable things; and I believe it was sent to France\u201d. An archival document, recently rediscovered, confirms Vasari\u2019s story. The painting is believed to have been painted by Rosso just before he left Rome. It is thought to have been commissioned by Giovanni Bandini, who belonged to the faction that opposed the Medici, and subsequently sent to France as a gift for King Francis I. Between 1568 and 1588, the canvas returned to Florence where it became part of the collections of Don Antonio de\u2019 Medici, son of the Grand Duke Francesco and Bianca Cappello. According to the most accredited interpretation, the painting portrays the agitated sequence of different events that make up the biblical episode from which it takes its name. After killing an Egyptian who had mistreated an Israelite woman, Moses flees to the desert and stops to rest at a well in Median, where the priest\u2019s seven daughters stop to draw water for their father\u2019s flock. Some shepherds arrive and want to drive the young girls away, but Moses leaps to the women\u2019s defences, making the bullies flee and drawing the water from the well for them. In the foreground Moses, depicted like a semi-nude Herculean hero, is tackling the shepherds, who lie on the ground, defeated. The victorious hero appears again in the background, running towards Zipporah, his future bride, who is still frightened. The biblical story is completed by the well in the background and the other six sisters, fleeing, fearful, towards the city. Rosso Fiorentino interprets the holy episode as a scene of nude figures fighting. Their powerful bodies, strained in an exasperated dynamism, resemble the tangle of soldiers in Michelangelo\u2019s Battaglia di Cascina cartoon. The longitudinal view of the composition and the use of the space divided into different vertical perspectives accentuate the violent effect of the struggle. The brutality of the fight is counterbalanced by the sensual suppleness of Zipporah, who is elegantly attired and swathed in a close-fitting robe that shows her figure and bares one of her breasts. The gift of this painting would certainly have been appreciated by King Francis I, a cultured, intellectual patron of the arts: the characterising expressive force and theatrical gestures of its characters are the same as those he would soon have admired in his Gallery in Fontainebleau, where Rosso replicated the postures of some of the nude figures in this work."}, {"title": "The Birth of Saint Nicholas", "artist": "Paolo Veneziano", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1631099566583958/17.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The panel depicts the birth of Saint Nicholas and his saintliness.

An inscription featuring the name of the saint (S. NICOLAUS) can be seen above the child's halo. In the background, Nicholas' mother rests in bed while two women bring her a nourishing meal. The panel \u2013 together with another compartment featuring the saint giving alms (Contini Bonacossi Inventory No. 7) \u2013 most likely belonged to an altarpiece dedicated to Saint Nicholas, whose relics have been kept in Bari since the eleventh century. The two paintings are attributed to the most important painter working in Venice in the first half of the fourteenth century, Paolo Veneziano. The painter successfully manages to reconcile Byzantine traditions rooted on the Adriatic coast with Giotto\u2019s innovative representations of space and volume, as is evident in the box-like architecture within which the scenes are set. The events are cleverly narrated by the figures\u2019 gestures and the accuracy of their carefully depicted garments, which follow fourteenth-century fashions. The two panels have occasionally been linked to a painting intended for the chapel of St. Nicholas in the Doge's Palace in Venice, for which Paolo Veneziano was paid in 1346.

The centaur, a mythical creature, combining man and beast, symbolises the feral instincts of humanity and therefore, the work is to be understood as an allegory to virtues that act as a brake on a bad-tempered, passionate temperament. A young woman wears a dress with repeat decoration of the three-ring insignia of the Medici family.

The painter had been born in Caversaccio in the province of Como, but we have evidence of him staying in Florence as early as in 1346. Having seen the work in the choir of the church of Ognissanti, Giorgio Vassari mentioned it in 1568, correctly attributing it to the artist from Lombardy, perhaps based on an inscription that was later lost. The structure of the entire work was designed to be very large and majestic and we can get an idea of what it would have looked like by comparing it with that of the polyptych kept in the Civic Museum of Prato, also painted by Giovanni da Milano in the same period. With the exception of a large empty space on the figure of the Virgin in the central compartment, the work in Prato has survived until the present day with the original carpentry almost intact. In the polyptych of Ognissanti the Coronation of the Virgin is thought to have been set in the centre, identified by academics as the one today preserved in the National Museum of Fine Arts of Buenos Aires. It was flanked by the panels now in the Uffizi, depicting pairs of Saints moving forward on foot as if in a procession, each one sporting the attributes that make them recognisable. Their robes, in harmonious, iridescent colours, are finely decorated. There are many details, notably including Saint Stephen\u2019s brocade dalmatic featuring plant patterns, the purplish silk cloak with gold trim worn by St John the Baptist and the refined periwinkle fabric with large roses worn by Saint Gregory. The figures\u2019 skin is extremely realistic and on close observation one can see that it is created using a very dense collection of tiny crossed lines, painted with the tip of the paintbrush. The five pieces of the predella enclose groups of smaller figures gathered together in choirs, each within a semi-circular arch: Virgins, Martyrs, Apostles, Patriarchs, Prophets. A 17th century description of the work by Father Antonio Tognocchi of Terrinca (1691) confirms that a sixth compartment on the right, depicting another two saints, is missing. This probably featured the Creation of Adam and Eve in the tondos at the top, a scene that would fit in with the other surviving ones, all inspired by the Book of Genesis. The same document recalls another two parts now lost, the Choir of Confessors, under Saint James the Greater and Saint Gregory, and the Choir of Angels under the central compartment. The polyptych of Ognissanti was therefore an impressive work measuring approximately four metres tall and over three metres wide. It was also part of a theological plan that mirrored the name of the church, dedicated to the Virgin and all the Saints, in Italian \u201cOgnissanti\u201d. And at the same time, it met the requirements of the religious community that had commissioned it, the Humiliati order who lived in the Florentine monastery. The panel was positioned above the mensa of the main altar: therefore, if we consider the architectural structure of medieval churches, it was located over the choir of the monks, typically closed in by a partition that separated it from the nave, and it was therefore meant to accommodate the monks in prayer. The changes made over the centuries within the church and changing tastes, led to the polyptych being first moved and then disassembled. Many of its parts were then dispersed and this seriously compromised its state of preservation. The Uffizi had it restored between 1858 and 1860, and subsequently purchased it for the sum of 2280 lire: the panels have been on display in the museum since 1863."}, {"title": "Portrait of Ainolfo de Bardi", "artist": "Carlo Dolci", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1543930565668876-Ainolfo-Intero.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Ainolfo de\u2019 Bardi, Knight of St John of Jerusalem, was \u201cchamberlain\u201d to Cosimo II and Ferdinand II, or rather their direct collaborator for issues that the Grand Duke oversaw personally.

Then, following the alliance of Pope Clement VII de\u2019Medici and Charles V, the opponents of the Medici were defeated by the imperial troops that besieged the city. Alessandro de\u2019 Medici, known as \u201cThe Moor\u201d, due to his dark complexion, was the natural son of Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, brother to the Pope, and a servant of mixed race. However, some believe that he was actually the son of the Pope, who asked the emperor to appoint him Duke of Florence. This portrait of Alessandro was commissioned to Vasari by Ottaviano de\u2019Medici, probably on the request of the duke himself, similarly to the circumstances that had preceded the commissioning of the Portrait of Lorenzo de\u2019Medici a few months earlier. Both paintings came with long accompanying letters revealing the allegorical meaning of the works, which aimed to celebrate the Medici dynasty under which the painter from Arezzo would continue to serve as court painter and architect throughout his artistic career. The young duke is portrayed full figure in a style that was unusual for the period, but in any case, clearly resembles that of the portrait of Giuliano de\u2019Medici painted by Michelangelo in the New Sacristy of the Basilica of San Lorenzo. The splendid armour he is wearing in the painting is the reflection of his qualities, whereas the red cloak draped over the stool symbolises the blood of his defeated enemies. The round stool indicates that his kingdom will be everlasting because his opponents, represented by the herms sculpted on its legs, have been overcome forever.

The subject\u2019s bald head and long white beard are, in fact, typical attributes of these characters, as well as his curved shoulders and downward-facing eyes. These traits connote an attitude of meditation, repentance,  and spiritual or intellectual reflection. The naturalistic rendering of the figure is such that, just by looking at it, the viewer can almost feel real tactile sensations. One seems to perceive the smoothness of the hairless head, the slight ripple of  wrinkles on the forehead and around the eyes, the softness of a beard that seems to have the consistency of cotton-wool, and the roughness of the modest fabric that he wears. Particularly significant is the use of color and light: the figure emerges from a black background due to a clever chiaroscuro contrast, created with a subtle, almost flickering luminosity, which gives the whole picture a sort of atmospheric instability. Cited in the inventory of the Uffizi of 1890 as a work by Pordenone, it was then attributed to Jacopo Bassano, and finally to Camillo Boccaccino (1501-1546). This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by the stylistic similarities of the painting at the Uffizi with two other works executed by Boccaccino at the turn of the first and second quarters of the sixteenth century: The Eternal Blessing at the Civic Museum of Cremona and the Isaiah, a canvas originally used as the door of the organ of the church of San Maria di Campagna in Piacenza, which is now exhibited in the Picture Gallery in Piacenza\u2019s Palazzo Farnese. Son of the Emilian painter Boccaccio, Camillo Boccaccino began his artistic journey following the example of masters such as Raphael, Correggio, and Pordenone. He later adopted the new refined Mannerist experiments of Parmigianino and Giulio Romano, without abandoning the preciousness of Titian\u2019s Venetian coloring, which he learned during his youth.\r\nHis untimely death unfortunately prevented Camillo from fully developing his artistic capabilities, which would probably have led him to far greater fame than he enjoys today."}, {"title": "Portrait of an old man (The Old Rabbi)", "artist": "Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1538140469019365-rembrandt.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Signed and dated in 1665, this portrait was created towards the end of Rembrandt's prolific artistic career, much of which was devoted to portrait painting.

The face of the old man in the portrait has been identified as that of a Rabbi; indeed, it has been suggested that the portrait can be attributed to a precise figure, Rabi Haham Saul Levy Morteira, but documents do not yet confirm this. In the portrait, Rembrandt studies the psychology of the elder man, emphasizing the detached pensiveness of his expression and the impression of being lost in thoughts, which seem engulfed by the painting's dark background.

In 1560, Francesco Maria II della Rovere\u2019s ambassador to Tuscany, Simone Fortuna wrote in a letter that Cosimo \u201cin his first years as duke, had, by a noblewoman of Florence, a girl who was baptised in the name of His Illustrious Excellence, and called Bia. And the Lady Duchess, finding her in her home, was raising the girl lovingly, as she was born to her husband before she became his wife.\u201d The young girl was therefore brought up, as often happened, alongside the legitimate children of the household, surrounded by the affection of Eleanor of Toledo and her grandmother, Maria Salviati, with whom she spent a great deal of time and who was particularly fond of her.  Unfortunately, at the age of about five, Bia suddenly fell ill towards the end of January 1542 and died within a few weeks. The duke was distraught and had a plaster funeral mask cast of the child, as listed in the Guardaroba inventory of 1553, which also contains the first record of the portrait of Bia by Bronzino, mentioned by Giorgio Vasari in his biography of the artist. Some scholars have advanced the theory that Bronzino did not paint the child while she was alive, but that he took the mask as his model. The date of the work is therefore between 1542 and 1545, when the painter also completed the Portrait of Eleanor of Toledo with her son, Giovanni (Uffizi) which uses the same solution as the other painting, placing the figure before a deep blue background that becomes lighter around the face.  In spite of the young girl\u2019s clothing, which is in white to allude both to her purity and her name, Bianca, and the abundance of jewels worthy of an adult princess, Bronzino\u2019s exceptional talent has given the living image of the child all of the vivacity of a painting done from life. This is also due to the seated position that sees the child almost ready to jump to her feet, with a barely contained exuberance, and the way that she fidgets with the belt between her fingers.   As well as the string of pearls around her neck, the child is also wearing a gold chain with a medal showing the profile of her father, Cosimo, as he appears in a portrait by Pontormo, now in the Palatine Gallery in Pitti Palace."}, {"title": "Portrait of Bishop of Bologna, Ludovico Beccadelli (1501-1572)", "artist": "Titian", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1534772488738352-Tiziano-Beccadelli-principale.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The painting is one of Titian\u2019s portraiture masterpieces, and it was painted in Venice in 1552, as documented by the letter unfolded in the hands of the bishop.

The work was immediately praised by Pietro Aretino, in a sonnet celebrating the qualities of its likeness to the model, and the ability of Titian to convey the calm and at the same time authoritative character of the subject through his painting.  Beccadelli was in fact an important personage in the circle of \u201cspiritual leaders\u201d or those who advocated a renewal from within the Church, during the difficult period of the Counter-Reformation.

Leopoldo de\u2019 Medici, who preferred the iconographic subject of the portrait would have been familiar with the figure of the Bolognese bishop, not only due to this latter\u2019s qualities as a fine man of letters, diplomat and also biographer of important humanists such as Pietro Bembo, but also because Beccadelli had spent almost a decade in Florence, from 1563, as the tutor of Ferdinand, son of Cosimo I.

Originally, the canvas was a companion piece to another double portrait, of the count\u2019s wife Livia and her daughter Porzia, now in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore (Maryland). The two canvases were probably hung at the sides of a window, as suggested by the specular origin of the light in each one. Veronese was one of the artists who decorated the palace belonging to the da Porto in Vicenza, completed in 1552 and built by Andrea Palladio. The date can be deduced - with a great deal of approximation - by the age of the two oldest children, depicted in the two paintings.  The period is probably 1552 and 1553, when Paolo moved to Venice and his portrait style took on its more notable influences from Titian, while here he maintains elements of traditional Lombard style. The subjects represented here are set in a faux shaded niche and painted full length, following a style that was typical of artists between Brescia and Bergamo, such as Giovan Battista Moroni, who was an important inspiration for Veronese.  Giuseppe da Porto is wearing a heavy black tunic, lined with fur and high on the leg. He is wearing a sword in his belt and a single glove, since he has removed the other to place his hand on the shoulder of his son, Adriano. The boy is also sumptuously dressed, with an ermine-lined jacket, decorated with gold embroidery. This portrait is a famous work from Veronese\u2019s young period and includes fundamental elements of his style.  The colour range is very well defined, with particular style characteristics, such as the bold iridescences, making it different from the tonal painting style of Veneto.

The position of the subject, shown to just under her chest, leaves out arms and hands to focus solely on the shoulders and the face, which are shown strictly from the front. The background shows a peaceful, light and airy landscape, typically Umbrian, with hillsides dotted with trees and high mountains in the background. The duchess is dressed in black, with a \u201cgamurra\u201d (or \u201ccamurra\u201d) dress decorated with rectangles set out in gold and silver, in an asymmetrical design, inspired by the heraldic colors of the Montefeltro family.

On her extremely white forehead is a jewel in the shape of a scorpion, containing a precious stone. At times, this piece of jewelery has been interpreted as an amorous symbol, with regard to the letter S that Elisabetta sports in one of the dialogs of the Courtier; however it may refer to Scorpio, the astrological sign linked to fertility and therefore, a good luck charm for the duchess, who was unable to have children due to her husband\u2019s sterility. The ultra-fine painting techniques, featuring contrasts between the deep shadow of the dress and the pale tones of the subject\u2019s skin, are, together with the painstaking attention to every detail, reminiscent of the Flemish examples that Raphael would have been able to see and study during his early years in Urbino, especially looking at the paintings of Justus van Gent and Pedro Berruguete in the Duke\u2019s study. However, these initial trials by the artist already show his aptitude for representing the stirrings of the soul, his desire to make even an official portrait such as that of Elisabetta more authentic and exciting, leaving the onlooker to experience all of the truth of the expression in that reserved, noble gaze, as well as in the still youthful curve of the lips."}, {"title": "Portrait of Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino", "artist": "Federico Barocci", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1615290832277818/18.-Barocci-Francesco-Maria-II-della-Rovere.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The young man in the painting is the last Duke of Urbino, Francesco Maria II della Rovere (1549- 1631), son of Guidobaldo II, who he succeeded in 1574, and nephew of Francesco Maria I, previously painted by Titian in 1538. It was precisely this model, which he was able to study in the Ducal Palace collections, which inspired Barocci in his choice of the young man's proud pose, three quarters of which is shown against an extra dark background in order to heighten the effects of the light on the parade armour, fine work done by a famous Italian armour workshop.

The half bust of the figure attracts the viewer's gaze to the pale face of the subject and to his gaze outside the frame, which was both inspired and visionary at the same time. At the time of the painting, Galileo was around 70 years old and had been forced into exile in the countryside just out of Florence, on the hill of Arcetri.

He was commissioned to paint this portrait by Ottaviano de\u2019 Medici, by request of the Duke Alessandro, who intended to commemorate his illustrious ancestor, and at the same time legitimise the family\u2019s return to power after the republican period.

His careful description of the painting enables us to identify all the elements of its allegorical meaning, and the iconographic complexity of this was probably orchestrated by Paolo Giovio, the painter\u2019s advisor and friend. Giovio, a learned historian and biographer, believed that a portrait should be accompanied by inscriptions with sententious phrases or praise that would help characterise the subject, a principle that he would follow when creating his famous \u201cgallery of the illustrious\u201d in his palace in Borgo Vico, on Lake Como. Vasari conceived this portrait of Lorenzo de\u2019Medici as a pendant of Pontormo\u2019s portrait of Cosimo the Elder, with the pose adopted by Lorenzo mirroring that of Cosimo. Lorenzo is depicted wearing the clothes he wore at home, as per the commissioner\u2019s wishes, but the fur lining on his sleeves is an indication of the subject\u2019s high social standing. He is leaning on a marble pillar decorated with a mask in relief. The Latin inscription reveals its meaning: \u201cAs my ancestors did with me, I too, with my virtue, shall light the way for my descendants\u201d. An ancient-style oil lamp, consisting of a porphyry base topped by a bizarre mask, sits on top of the pillar. Vasari clarifies how it works: the oil falls on to the forehead of the mask, gushing forth from the horns to fuel the papyrus wick protruding from the mask\u2019s wide, open mouth. He explains that, just as the function of the papyrus was to light up everything around it, in the same way, the eloquence and wisdom of Lorenzo indicated the path for his descendants to follow. On the right, there is another marble base, on which we read \u201cVirtue triumphs over vices\u201d. Vice is symbolised by the monstrous mask laid on top of the pillar and squashed by a finely sculpted vase, identified by the inscription as \u201cthe vase of all virtues\u201d. Another mask is hanging on the spout of the vase, and this one is defined by Vasari as \u201cclean and very beautiful\u201d; the reward of all virtues\u201d. Therefore, we see that by exercising virtue, Lorenzo has been remembered and praised by his descendants as an excellent, pure soul.

As a sign of the deep appreciation of the work, which together with its companion piece, a portrait of the Countess  (Inv.1890 no.1008), formed the writer\u2019s official iconography, Alfieri wrote the following sonnet on the back of the painting, perhaps in his own hand:  \u201cThou mirror of veracious speech sublime, / What I am like in soul and body, show; / Red hair,  - in front grown somewhat thin with time;/ Tall stature, with an earthward head bowed low; / A meagre form, with two straight legs beneath; / An aspect good; white skin with eyes of blue; / A proper nose; fine lips and choicest teeth; / Face paler than a throned king\u2019s in hue;/ Now hard and bitter; yielding now and mild; /  Malignant never, passionate alway, / With mind and heart in endless strife embroiled; / Sad mostly, and then gayest of the gay. / Achilles now, Thersites in his turn: /  Man, art thou great or vile? Die, and thou\u2019lt learn!\u201d"}, {"title": "Portrait of Young Girl", "artist": "Francesco Furini", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1545311609866631-furini-ritratto-di-fanciulla-princ.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The identity of the young girl in this portrait, who seems to be around twelve - thirteen years old, is unknown. The elegant pink dress, decorated with fun black bows and completed by a white pinafore in fancy weave, worn with a string of pearls, means that the customer was doubtless a person of standing, and someone passionate about this type of painting, used for private and family rooms. The subject gazes out directly with an absorbed, almost melancholy expression. Her face, with its naturally soft complexion and plump, half-closed lips, reveals a careful study from life, carried out by the painter not without first having sketched out the balanced forms.  The effectiveness of the painting is sustained by the particular technique of oil on copper, widespread from the mid-16th century, in parallel with the popularity of copperplate engraving.  The metal alloy, considered to be as durable and strong as marble or wood, was useful in bringing out the full effects of preciousness and the textural impact of even the tiniest of details; this is why it was a preferred choice for smaller works, although it was not rare for it to be applied in larger paintings and even on altar pieces. As for the artist behind this delightful painting, different names have been put forward over the years: from Furini to Vignali, Mazzoni and Felice Ficherelli. The soft brushwork and the subtle hint of sensuality running through the painting, seem to be compatible with the methods of Francesco Furini, which emerge when comparing this head with the red pencil drawings of the 40s or with paintings such as the Allegory of Poetry in the National Gallery in Edinburgh."}, {"title": "Portraits of Agnolo and Maddalena Doni (front); the Flood and Deucalion and Pyrrha (back)", "artist": "Raffaello Sanzio and Maestro di Serumido", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1548765683018814-doni.jpg?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "The two paintings portray Agnolo Doni (1474-1539), a rich fabric merchant and prominent figure among the Florentine upper class, and his wife, noblewoman Maddalena Strozzi (1489-1540), who married on 31 January 1504. According to Giorgio Vasari (Le Vite, Edizione Giuntina 1568) the works were commissioned to Raphael by Agnolo: \u201cWhilst he was living in Florence, Agnolo Doni, who was very careful with his money in other things but willing to spend it, although still with the greatest possible economy - on works of painting and sculpture, in which he much delighted, asked him [Raphael] to make portraits of himself and of his wife; these may be seen in the possession of Giovan Battista, his son, in the beautiful and most comfortable house of Agnolo, on Corso de\u2019 Tintori, near the Canto degli Alberti, in Florence.\u201d Agnolo also commissioned the round painting of the Holy Family, known as the Tondo Doni, to Michelangelo Buonarroti. Both portraits were painted en pendant and originally formed a diptych, held together by hinges that made it possible to look at the scenes painted on the backs. These are two episodes, one a consequence of the other, taken from Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses: The Flood, on the back of Agnolo\u2019s portrait, and the following rebirth of humanity thanks to Deucalion and Pyrrha, on the back of the portrait of Maddalena. These stories, painted in monochrome, were the work of a colleague of the young Raphael, whose identity remains anonymous but who is thought to be the so-called Maestro di Serumido, a figure identified by Federico Zeri, who attributed a group of works in similar style to this same artist. The choice to paint the works in black and white reflects a taste for the Flemish styles that were popular in 15th- and 16th-century Florence, where the panels of diptychs and triptychs would traditionally have monochrome decorations on the back. The two scenes are to be interpreted as allegories that seem to wish fertility to the marriage. Ovid narrates how the gods allowed Deucalion and Pyrrha, an elderly couple without children to save themselves from the flood and to restore life to mankind after it. On the order of Zeus, the pair threw stones over their shoulders, and once they touched the oil, the stones became people \u2013 the ones thrown by Deucalion became men and the ones thrown by Pyrrha, women. These references strengthen the theory, put forward by the majority of critics, that the portraits were commissioned for the marriage of the young couple, dating them to somewhere between 1504 and 1506, the year in which the furniture for the Donis\u2019 marriage chamber was completed by Francesco del Tasso and Morto da Feltre. The first of the portraits by Raphael was that of Maddalena: radiographic analysis has shown that he made changes to background, initially conceived to be an interior, so that it overlooked a landscape through a side opening, while the portrait of Agnolo was directly inserted into the landscape, creating visual continuity with that of his bride. These two masterpieces mark an essential stage not only in Raphael\u2019s art, but also in the tradition of Florentine portraiture which, by developing solutions previously formulated by Verrocchio in the Woman with Flowers, and by Leonardo in the Mona Lisa, come to a new natural style of half-bust presentation. The links to the Mona Lisa are so close as to lead one to think that Raphael was himself able to study it in Florence, at least towards the end of 1504. Raphael distances himself from Leonardo\u2019s model by preferring to use a solid, clear approach to space, lowering the horizon behind the figures and bringing them strongly to the foreground, according to models influenced by his own teacher, Pietro Perugino and by the Flemish painters of the late 15th century, such as Hans Memling. The fascinating use of the sfumato technique, as seen on the Mona Lisa has been replaced by an absolutely clear use of shape and colour, by a descriptive language that pauses on the detailed portrayal of the faces, fabrics and jewels. Maddalena\u2019s pendant is particularly significant, formed by a gold, unicorn-shaped mount and three precious stones (ruby, emerald and sapphire), and by a pearl, an element that alludes to virginal purity and marital fidelity. In Vasari\u2019s period, the portraits were still in the family home in Corso Tintori, where they were seen by Raffaello Borghini (1584) and Giovanni Cinelli (1667). From this date, there is not much information about them. They most definitely remained with the Doni family if, in 1826,  Leopold II Grand Duke of Tuscany was able to buy them from the heirs and add them to the collection of paintings he was creating in the Palatine Gallery in Palazzo Pitti. Since 5 June 2018, the Doni portraits have been displayed in the Uffizi Galleries alongside Michelangelo\u2019s Tondo Doni, hung on new supports that allow the stories on their reverse sides to be admired."}, {"title": "Presentation at the Temple", "artist": "Ambrogio Lorenzetti", "img_url": "https://images.uffizi.it/production/attachments/1506001234417779-Lorenzetti-Presentazione-al-tempio-PRINCIPALE.png?ixlib=rails-2.1.3&w=1200&h=800&fit=clip&crop=center&fm=pjpg&auto=compress", "desc": "Inscribed at the bottom with the painter\u2019s name and the date, 1342, this masterpiece was painted for the chapel of San Crescenzio in the transept of the Cathedral of  Siena. It was part of a small group of altar pieces, dedicated to the Virgin Mary and her life, painted by Siena\u2019s most important artists in the first half of the 14th century for the five transept altars in the Cathedral. Ambrogio Lorenzetti\u2019s work shows the presentation at the temple and the purification of Mary, forty days after giving birth, according to Hebrew rituals. Mary, who can be recognised by her usual blue cloak and red dress, is holding her son out to Simeon and to the prophetess Anna, both of whom recognise the Child as being the Messiah. Anna is holding a scroll citing a passage from the Gospels, narrating this event (Luke 22,38). On the altar, the priest is sacrificing the gifts brought by Mary and Joseph. Joseph is shown alone, on the far left. The temple, for which we can see both interior and exterior, according to mediaeval custom, is imagined by Ambrogio Lorenzetti as a church, with columns, starry vaults, paintings and windows. The converging widths of the polychrome marble floor serve to enhance the idea of depth, showing the artist\u2019s interest in depicting spatiality. The painting is extraordinary for its wealth of details, inspired by daily life, such as the jewellery decorating the women\u2019s ears, or the childish pose of Jesus, who is shown sucking his thumb, giving a highly spontaneous character to the holy subject. The altarpiece is without its original pinnacles and two side panels depicting saints. Originally, therefore, it must have been a tryptych, similarly to the other side altarpieces from the transept of the Cathedral of Siena, like the Annunciation by Simone Martini. At the top, outside the frame, are the prophets Moses and Malachi."}]
